I’d say the birds are stronger than the rats and can easily take them out in a full out assault but the rats could just move through the giant underground New York has and basically get into anywhere pigeon man might be

R2: pigeons take this easy, if there’s no prep time and it’s a full out assault the pigeons could simply swarm together and take every rat into the air and drop them and they all go splat 

R3: this one to me depends entirely on what time it is, because rat man could very easily hid his rats in groups at night and have them eviscerate pigeon man but in the day pigeon man would know where to position his birds so that they could make the rats go splats like in R2

Bonus: What kind of damage?

So long as Rat Man stays indoors, maintains a low profile, and makes sure to stay well away from windows then he is basically safe in perpetuity, while Pigeon Man can't hole up anywhere long because the rats will find him and eventually become so concentrated they'll kill him (as far as the 2-1 advantage goes, rats are by themselves bigger and stronger than pigeons are, and so while a pigeon could harry a rat, if the rat gets a hold of one it's game over).

R2 - Rat Man. Rat nests are, by and large, less exposed to pigeons than pigeon nests are to rats. Add the fact that I think the rat K/D would probably be somewhere in the neighborhood to 3-4 pigeons per rat killed, while it would be bloody I just don't think that the pigeons can manage forever. It would take years, decades maybe, but a grounded pigeon is vulnerable to rats, while a rat is only really in danger of multiple pigeons. The rats can sleep in safety, hide in places pigeons don't typically look, and when the pigeons need food, the rats will be in prime position to launch hit and run attacks. If a rat gets caught by a flock of pigeons it'll be a mess, sure, but rats are adapted to staying well out of sight, while pigeons aren't necessarily the same way. When they need to sleep, they'll need to trust whatever ledge or nest they're in will be secure, but I've seen rats walk tightropes already, those fuckers are mobile, so no pigeon is safe all the time.

R3 - Pigeon Man. A pitched battle is tough, and while I still want to favor the rats I think the pigeons' sheer numbers and mobility will be enough to carry the day, though I think there will be more pigeons dead than rats. The pigeons would be able to fly down in tandem, carry away a rat, and drop it. If the rats catch the pigeons then that's game over, sure, but the sheer volume of pigeons as opposed to rats I think makes this way more fair to the pigeons.

BONUS - Rat Man. Pigeons will swoop people, causing several initial car wrecks and injuries. First responders are dive bombed and attacked with such intensity that some of those injured are left for themselves. Anyone who can shelter inside does so, and it will be only in very few buildings that pigeons would be able to enter in numbers great enough to cause serious damage. Some apartments are broken into by pigeons flying in through open windows or simply kamikazing themselves through the glass, but those would be relatively few and far between. That kind of sustained assault wouldn't be possible forever, especially when SWAT teams and the National Guard are called up as the city is immediately placed under a state of emergency. 

Meanwhile, with everyone trapped inside, the rats just chew a few wires and whoosh, hundreds of building fires spread throughout the city, with first responders having to brave flocks of thousands of birds to even get to where the fires are. EMTs and fire fighters need escorts to protect them from the pigeons, but hundreds if not thousands die from fires spread throughout the city. Some blocks might even be burnt to the ground, as the sheer volume of calamities forces authorities to weigh what they can feasibly save.

When fires are impossible or improbable for the rats, they simply ruin the food in most peoples' pantries, able to attack anything short of canned or jarred foods. Tens of thousands of pounds of food are suddenly inedible. While this may not necessarily be an issue to homeowners, who might have more canned or jarred food rats can't realistically get to, for the hundreds or thousands who were suddenly stranded in centers which might only have pantry goods, if they have food at all, the fear of starvation suddenly becomes a very real issue. Government responses are likely able to save thousands, and this whole terror would probably be settled well before mass starvation becomes a concern, the very old, very young, and already malnourished starve. 

In hospitals, all manner of life-saving equipment is made inoperable through rats chewing through wires. Life support machines and ventilators, especially, are targeted. PPE in hospitals, such as masks, scrubs, and gowns, are chewed to ribbons, meaning viral transmission stemming from hospitals suddenly becomes a massive concern. Those who would otherwise have been able to be saved die, and those who otherwise would not have gotten sick do. 

More direct attacks against people by rats, while rare, do happen, primarily against those who shelter from the pigeons in the subways. Dozens if not hundreds of people are devoured by a tide of hungry rats below the city, likely not even able to escape to the streets as most subways will likely have been gated shut to prevent the pigeons from getting down. However, some isolated buildings, primarily those for vulnerable communities such as the mentally infirm or the very old, are also met with attacks, some of which are successful and some of which are not.

The situation is eventually resolved after maybe a week or two of anarchy and chaos. Some isolated incidents of gun or weapon wielding civilians running into the street are recorded and go viral as they are swallowed by flocks of pigeons or swarms of rats, but those are hardly the rule. During that time, thousands have died, but perhaps tens of thousands more will die from the complete mauling of the New York medical system. The National Guard and SWAT will also only be able to stop the worst of this, killing the vast majority of both animals' populations and devastating the ecosystem of the city at large. Some of the rare (but still present) larger animals, such as coyotes, become more aggressive, killing house pets and attacking people with alarming frequency as they are deprived of some of their greatest food sources, and are likewise killed in large numbers. Similar mass killings of pigeons and rats can be seen across the world, and some pet owners will be crushed when legislation is passed banning the ownership of either animal in some cities, states, or countries. This event will have thousands of books, mini-series, and movies made about it in the following century.

TLDR; The pigeons cause a heap of initial panic and are able to keep the city shut down for days if not weeks, but the rats cause the real damage, primarily through infrastructural sabotage.",r rat man rat large able way place pigeon whereas pigeon limit break lack rat insane rteeth hand like paw reason people worry pigeon chilling wall rat man shelter right place like basement pigeon basically sol take pigeon man wading fortress rodent break long rat man stay indoors maintains low profile make sure stay well away window basically safe perpetuity pigeon man hole anywhere long rat find eventually become concentrated kill far advantage go rat bigger stronger pigeon pigeon could harry rat rat get hold one game r rat man rat nest large le exposed pigeon pigeon nest rat add fact think rat k probably somewhere neighborhood pigeon per rat killed bloody think pigeon manage forever take year decade maybe grounded pigeon vulnerable rat rat really danger multiple pigeon rat sleep safety hide place pigeon typically look pigeon need food rat prime position launch hit run attack rat get caught flock pigeon mess sure rat adapted staying well sight pigeon necessarily way need sleep need trust whatever ledge nest secure seen rat walk tightrope already fucker mobile pigeon safe time r pigeon man pitched battle tough still want favor rat think pigeon sheer number mobility enough carry day though think pigeon dead rat pigeon able fly tandem carry away rat drop rat catch pigeon game sure sheer volume pigeon opposed rat think make way fair pigeon bonus rat man pigeon swoop people causing several initial car wreck injury first responder dive bombed attacked intensity injured left anyone shelter inside building pigeon able enter number great enough cause serious damage apartment broken pigeon flying open window simply kamikazing glass relatively far kind sustained assault possible forever especially swat team national guard called city immediately placed state emergency meanwhile everyone trapped inside rat chew wire whoosh hundred building fire spread throughout city first responder brave flock thousand bird even fire emts fire fighter need escort protect pigeon hundred thousand die fire spread throughout city block might even burnt ground sheer volume calamity force authority weigh feasibly save fire impossible improbable rat simply ruin food people pantry able attack anything short canned jarred food ten thousand pound food suddenly inedible may necessarily issue homeowner might canned jarred food rat realistically hundred thousand suddenly stranded center might pantry good food fear starvation suddenly becomes real issue government response likely able save thousand whole terror probably settled well mass starvation becomes concern old young already malnourished starve hospital manner life saving equipment made inoperable rat chewing wire life support machine ventilator especially targeted ppe hospital mask scrub gown chewed ribbon meaning viral transmission stemming hospital suddenly becomes massive concern otherwise able saved die otherwise gotten sick direct attack people rat rare happen primarily shelter pigeon subway dozen hundred people devoured tide hungry rat city likely even able escape street subway likely gated shut prevent pigeon getting however isolated building primarily vulnerable community mentally infirm old also met attack successful situation eventually resolved maybe week two anarchy chaos isolated incident gun weapon wielding civilian running street recorded go viral swallowed flock pigeon swarm rat hardly rule time thousand died perhaps ten thousand die complete mauling new york medical system national guard swat also able stop worst killing vast majority animal population devastating ecosystem city large rare still present larger animal coyote become aggressive killing house pet attacking people alarming frequency deprived greatest food source likewise killed large number similar mass killing pigeon rat seen across world pet owner crushed legislation passed banning ownership either animal city state country event thousand book mini series movie made following century tldr pigeon cause heap initial panic able keep city shut day week rat cause real damage primarily infrastructural sabotage,t3_hzyt71,1596062877,Negative,-0.2047813953,0.06969767442,0.1129302326,0.8174186047,1185

If you call 311 and say ""I have a rat problem"" they won't care much, but if your landlord is neglecting the property and ignoring your complaints then you will get much more immediate action.

In fact know of none where that is unequivocally the case. This approach is nonetheless often one of the first solutions attempted to perceived pest population problems, and hence the source of many problems associated with invasive exotic species in all sorts of habitats around the world. 

There are three main problems with introduced predators. 

1. Getting hold of them and keeping them is difficult. Breeding predatory species is difficult and expensive, in general. They also tend to kill each other, and naturally occur at relatively low densities. Attempts to artificially raise their numbers usually result in many dying or moving out of the control area, as their population attempts to stabilise itself. 

2. Unintended side-effects - this is the big one. A predator that eliminates its prey population is not going to survive. So if allowed to behave naturally such a population would in any case never succeed. If a population does become established it can start behaving in unexpected ways. It is very hard to predict what these might be, and the examples, particularly in the new world, of introduced species causing havoc in native ecosystems are too many to count. [http://www.cbd.int/invasive/WhatareIAS.shtml] (U.N. CBD Invasive Species page)

3. The oversupply (or perceived oversupply) of the pest species is usually caused by something, and if you do not also address that root cause then the problem will probably not be resolved by introductions alone. So it is better to try these other solutions first. 

Concerning releasing a single gender of predatory animal. As a side-note I don't know how this would work but I would not be optimistic. Predatory animals are not simple killing machines, they form populations and interact with each other. Let alone the logistics of obtaining a large and constantly renewed supply of a single gender of these animals the resulting population would probably be so busy fighting itself that it would have little effectiveness as a predatory force.

If I'm not clear on some of this, forgive me, English is almost my native language, but I still make mistakes when I'm really mad. Like NOW. 

I hope you did tell your husband, even if he didn't see it. These things have a way of coming out. In addition, since there was no return address, that rat could easily have been meant as a threat to your husband, and should have been reported IMMEDIATELY. I don't know how long it's been, but I'd def still take a chance and report it, UPS and other delivery services keep track of deliveries for a LONG time, and it could still be investigated as a thread. There's also the issue of them wishing you would be killed by a terrorist. Hajji? Seriously? Do they even know what the word means? It is someone who has been to Haj, not a fucking Genii, like in I Dream of Jeannie. Ignorant, racist motherfuckers. If you got that bullet threat on social media, that can be traced even if the user deleted it. If by email, voicemail or text, EVEN BETTER.

Police banging on your door is a good deterrent to future harassment. I hope nothing like this happens again, but if you can, please think about reporting it. If only to prevent your husband from asking 'why didn't you tell me', if another event happens. Such as a nasty or threatening letter, someone taking bad pics of you with bedhair and posting them on social media or any petty thing that can be mistaken as some kind of implied threat.

I lived there for two years between 2005-2007, and I only ever entertain the notion of a day-visit to see the Nintendo store with my kid. New York was one of the worst geographical experiences of my life.

San Francisco gets a bad rap for being dirty. New York City’s about four times filthier.

New York is the only place I’ve ever been where inconveniences and backward approach is celebrated as character and charm.

In 2007, about 1 in 8 establishments accepted a credit card. Maybe this is more modernized now, but I doubt it.

Everything is overpriced and ridiculous, even in the far flung reaches of Brooklyn, where I lived (Bay Ridge).

I was trying to study media and video with some friends who had somewhat recently graduated form the NYFA and had decent positions in television and a steady stream of freelance work. While I was learning software and basic principles form them, I worked in retail. I worked at Target, Toys R Us, and Best Buy.

The Target where I worked was in Flatbush as part of some kind of outdoor mall thing they were building. It was completely disgusting. It was filled with roaches and rats, none of the employees ever did anything (except throw TVs and Microwaves off the top storage shelves, angry someone got corned and was forced to call upstairs for one), employees would drop food items in mystery goo puddles and just put them back on the storage shelves. I was made head of a department (a department that just rescanned everything in the backroom back into their locations for inventory, because people wouldn’t do it and everyone stole) my third week, because nobody else did anything but steal, break shit, and say constant racist things about the Jewish and Asian customers who would come in. I felt sorry for every customer I saw order Starbucks or Pizza Hut inside the store.

For the first three months I lived there, I wanted to burn my shoes at the end of the day, just from walking outside on the ground.

Everyone there acts like all the gross, inconvenience, and lack of up-to-date technology is cool. I expected New York to be at least as technologically sound as the Cleveland suburbs where I grew up, but it was about 15 years behind, and when you point it out, people accuse you of being soft (again, this was 2005-2007, maybe things have changed, but I doubt it). Therefore, nothing really ever gets fixed.

I’d actually argue, in terms of standards of living and modern life, if not for the hipsters, New York would probably still be stuck in the 80’s, rather than the 90’s like it was when I was there.

I know there’s 4 million of them, but only so many can surround a building, shed, whatever at one time, and that number isn’t enough to do damage/ break in to a structure. Not before the rats can break into something equivalent. I used to work in a hardware store with constant rat problems. They’d chew through the concrete and the brickwork. They are getting in long before pigeons are. 

R2: team rat again. Pigeons outnumber the rats 2-1. They have a huge advantage in mobility. However there’s really nothing they can do with it. They don’t have talons, their beaks aren’t powerful (and if they’re close enough to the rats to peck, they’re probably already being killed by the rat. Even 2-1 they can’t lift the rats (average NYC rat is 16 inches long and 454g Some get up to 20 inches and 900g. Rock pigeons weigh 360g) They can’t even use their speed and mobility to dive bomb. They’re not built fo it. Their bones are brittle and they’d break before the rats using that strategy. I don’t even think they could lift anything heavy enough to hurt the rats when dropped. Their beaks and feet aren’t equipped to lift, and they almost definitely don’t have the accuracy to land kill shots regardless. I don’t think there’s a meaningful thing they can do to the rats but if they get close the rats can certainly inflict lethal damage.

R3: the same for similar reasons. I do believe a person could fight off 4 million pigeons than they could fight off 2 million rats. Rats are not nice people. 

R4: again, rats can chew through concrete, power lines whatever they want really. In a combined, coordinated effort they’d be a borderline WMD.

But if you were, surely you'd know that Manhattan is RIFE with shitty, broken down buildings.  Have you ever apartment shopped for god's sake?  Bathrooms that are a foot above the level of the adjacent room (which causes flooding).  Kitchens that have illegal gas pipe set ups.  Leaks, roaches, rats.  The lower east side for gods sake is just horrific housing.

> I'm not saying it doesn't happen, I'm saying that having these problems go unaddressed for a long period of time is not a normal experience.

I really don't think that's true but can accept that you have a different opinion.

> Paying for a contractor to do it and WITHHOLDING rent when done correctly won't necessarily put OP onto the blacklist. 

Agree, but that's what I suggested.  Only the way I suggested it was slightly different. I recommended that HE do it himself (to minimize cost) and that HE keep receipts and take it out of his final month's check (or the month before that if he fears not getting the deposit back).  If a contractor is NEEDED then that would be the next logical step.  You and I just disagree on whether a contractor is needed.  Also you don't seem to agree with me that getting a high priced contractor will likely INCREASE rent the following year which is something I assume OP wants to avoid (which is why I said to do it himself).

That's our issue.  You read ""reimbursement"" (fairly so) to mean the landlord would actually PAY the tenant.  I meant it in the sense the tenant would take it out of the rent.  We were saying the same thing.

Rats can cause more damage, and are tougher to kill plus have a much faster respawn.

Other, more aggressive tactics would be fine, as he could duck inside at the sight of any pigeon swarms and then wait for BirdMan to arrive. Then he has to deal with swarms of rats whilst inside where his birds will be unable to help.

Round 2- rats can reproduce faster than pigeons but are more limited in where they can hide. Also other humans are intent on wiping out rats. Overall, it'd say this is likely a stalemate.

If the rats and pigeons just blindly started killing until the lease of the other team died, pest control would be called and the rat and pigeons population would die, so surveillance is the only option. The pigeon king could use pigeons to take over the top floor of a tall building and have pigeons bring food, but the rats could storm the building and if that doesn’t work they could keep suicide bombing the top floors until the pigeon king was forced to flee. The pigeon king could use pigeons to lift him up and Carry him away, but even if the pigeon swarm could carry their ruler to safety, the rats could use guns and small projectiles to attack, even slingshotting themselves at the pigeon swarm.

Forced perspective is a technique which employs optical illusion to make an object appear farther away, closer, larger or smaller than it actually is. It manipulates human visual perception through the use of scaled objects and the correlation between them and the vantage point of the spectator or camera. It has uses in photography, filmmaking and architecture.

For one, there is only one road that connects Alaska to the rest of the continent; the AlCan highway. Rig that up with mining explosives and nobody is driving into Alaska. 

This goes for many of the port towns sprinkled throughout the Southern region of the state. Knockout the single connecting roads and those port towns are now useless. This goes for just about every population center. Airfields can be destroyed to ward off flights in.

Also, the sheer vastness of the state, it's inhospitable terrain and long, deadly winters would go far to even the playing field to such an overwhelming invasion force of 8million. The Southern region of the state is covered in impassable forests and mountains. Alaskans are not only well armed but also well stocked (relatively) for outdoor/subsistence survival via skill sets, supplies and equipment. Should forces start to invade, Alaskans have a huge advantage in exercising guerilla tactics to pick off the large swaths of NYC invaders. 

All that said, I think odds are stacked in NYC's favor given the sheer volume of people, the biological warfare potential in rats (as opposed to wolves) and resources at it's disposal.

A good example of a hemorrhagic disease being controlled well while it still being in the eco System is the Hendra virus in my home city of Brisbane, Australia. No one here is really worried about it, because we have good quarantine and identification methods. Hendra has many similarities to Ebola, including it's mortality rate.

The human body (dry, clean and properly hydrated) has about 100,000 Ohms of resistance. Wet or broken skin may drop the body's resistance to 1,000 Ohms.  Dehydration similarly lowers it due to increased electrolyte per volume.  

The human body on dry soil can withstand about 50-75 Volts from head to toe.  Add rubber shoes and that number doubles.  Put rubber gloves on or EH shoes and that number can multiply by 50 times.  Stand in a puddle and that number drops, significantly.  

Ground is very relative.  A human on the ground in the subway is likely touching some metal.  Most likely another rail, standing in one of those stank puddles, or holding onto something for balance.  All things that wil kill them.

3981,10589,10589,202f7y,cfzi4mg,5,t3_202f7y,"I was working at a rustic tourist spot in the foothills of Colorado.  We sold fudge.  A lot of different kinds, including both chocolate and chocolate walnut fudge.  The way we told the difference was that we embedded walnuts in the top of the chocolate walnut fudge when it was still cooling.  Well, one day we were pulling the pans of fudge out from the cabinet shelves, and thought we had run out of chocolate walnut fudge, but it turned out only the walnuts were missing from the top of the fudge.

Now, we kept the fudge in a closed cabinet every night.  I checked it with the flashlight, and we couldn't figure out how a mouse could even get in.  We threw away a lot of fudge.  Apparently the rat (We later found out it was not a mouse) had urinated on the fudge (Now you know why I didn't tell you where I worked) and a customer called and said it had made her sick.  So we put out a mousetrap, but it didn't get anything, even though it was set off the first night, and never caught anything again (rats are smart)

Well, a few days went by.  There was a lovely young couple, in love, sitting at one of the restaurant's tables looking deeply into each others' eyes.  And a rat sauntered right out into the middle of the restaurant floor and stood up on its haunches looking around.  The owner's wife saw it and grabbed my arm, gasped, and started shaking.  She left bruises on my arm.  I calmly waited for the lovely couple to glance over and see the rat not five feet from them.  They didn't.  The rat then dashed into a tiny hole in the condiment island I hadn't even known existed.

By the way, this is a great metaphor for the obliviousness of those in love to life's sometimes ugliness.

Well, now we knew it was a rat, not a mouse, and a big, sleek, round-eared, bright-eyed walnut-fed rat, at that.  Now I was really perplexed.  How the hell did that thing find a way into the fudge cabinet?  I looked everywhere with a flashlight, but never could find a hole, of any size.

One of the other employees brought a pellet gun.  He promptly got into an argument with another employee who was a vegetarian and wanted everybody to know the rat was here first and had rights.  We decided ricochets were too much of a hazard anyway and vetoed the rat hunt.  I shrugged and asked management to send over a live-catch trap, with the intention of doing a catch, relocate and release far from human habitation (did anyone else used to watch ""Wild Kingdom""?).  

The live catch trap was slow to show up, and meanwhile the owner's wife bought a standard rat trap - it looked like a mousetrap, but big enough to break your finger if you messed up when you were setting it.  I baited it with peanut butter and a walnut.

The next morning I came in and management had dropped off the live catch trap, which was sitting on the floor next to the dead rat in the trap, which I disposed of before opening.  I told the vegetarian the rat was dead, and he indignantly pointed at the live catch trap and looked outraged.

> They can sense through their animals senses. They have the mental acuity  and multi-tasking ability to accurately control themselves and all of  their animals at once without being overwhelmed. The animals can be made  to leave the city, but then control is broken. 

This does not specifically deny that the two parahumans in question are able to let animal autonomy  enter into how they control their animals.  It all depends on what is meant by ""control themselves and all of their animals at once without being overwhelmed.""  I say this could very well include a subset of ""control"" where the parahuman gives broad objectives, and lets the animals, at some level, figure shit out on their own.  You appear to disagree.  That's fine.  I say it's simply *unclear*, given the prompt, if this is, or is not possible.  Without W.o.G. from the person who started the prompt, we're simply at an impasse.

However the example given where Skitter controls her bugs, would support my argument.  Skitter was perturbed and annoyed that she had to  control every motion of Atlas, rather than setting a goal for him, and letting its instincts autopilot some of it's behaviors.  Letting the instinctual behaviors of her insects contribute to her control was a part of Skitter's power.  Given that her character's power and this prompt's powers are so similar, I thought it reasonable that they might further resemble each other in ways not explicitly stated.

4399,14436,14436,152bvl,c7ivcip,4,t3_152bvl,"A common misconception about rats is that they live in subway tunnels.  There is no reason for a rat to live in the subway system.  It's dark, the earth is compact and hard to dig through, and there is no food source for them to eat.  The exception to this rule is when you get homeless people squatting in subway tunnels - there food will attract rats.  Rats live at individual subway stations.  They typically will live in the cinderblock walls.  At night, garbage is stored in sanitation rooms by the MTA, and is often disposed of the next morning.  The rats will come out of the cinderblock walls to eat this garbage, then they will eat the trash people throw on the tracks.  The rats you see in the subway aren't living in the system, they live in the wall you probably leaned against while waiting for your train.

I won't go into the problem of introducing a predator; I think the other comments have summed up why this big problem.  You technically cannot own ferrets in NYC, and they have been blamed for killing songbirds (wether or not this is true is debatable, since they also supposedly are used to pickpocket people).  Cats are great at killing rodents, but the food put out to feed feral cats will often feed more rats than the cats are able to kill.  Cats add to rodent problems.  Owls are great rat hunters.  However, they are very susceptible to rodenticides.  There are not many wild owls that unsuccessfully survive in NYC.  

The best natural predator you can find in NYC is red-tailed hawks.  Red-tailed hawks are diurnal predators and cannot be used in subways.  NYC's most famous hawk is named Pale Male.  He's 21 and has successfully fathered many hawks.  There are currently 68 known red-tailed hawks in NYC.  Unfortunately, these hawks are often killed by rodenticides ingested from poisoned rats.  The parks try and foster these hawks populations by banning the use of rodenticides.  Still, a red-tailed hawk can hunt over a 1 mile radius; you cannot keep the hawks from eating poisoned rats caught in areas that do use rodenticides.  As a result, there have been 4 hawks found dead this year alone.  These hawks, though good predators, cannot be expected to control the hundreds of rats you can find living in just one park.

The best way to treat a rat infestation is sanitation.  I can try and find studies if people want it, but sanitation has been found to be much more effective at controlling rats than poisons.  The next step taken should be to rat proof the area with the infestation.  Sanitation and rat-proofing will dramatically reduce a rat population.  So if the solution is rather simple (properly dispose of trash overnight, and seal the cinderblock walls), why do  we have a rat problem still?  Money.  There's never enough money.  The MTA never seems to have enough money - they are more concerned with improving lines.  The city recently cut the sanitation budget.  There isn't enough money to ""simply"" dispose of the garbage earlier.  Still, the best way to control rats, in your home, parks, work, or subway, is proper sanitation, not predators.

Let's try this from a different angle.

Two ideas come to me.  

Firstly, people will always be lazy, if given the chance.  If controlling every aspect of your millions - strong swarm of rats/pigeons is in any way more difficult than kinda-controlling your swarm, people are gonna be inclined to be lazy, and take the easier option, at least sometimes.  Especially if loosely setting goals, and letting instinct of rats/pigeons take the fore still lets you achieve your goal.  Provided that doing so will not sacrifice any quality of service provided by the swarm.  (Also, people gotta sleep.  What happens to the swarms when their masters are drowsy, sick, or unconscious?  Having the ability to set and forget tasks while the Master is indisposed would be a damn useful side-power to have, yes?)

Secondly, imagine what a human controlled swarm might look like.  Unnatural.  Eerily coordinated.  But, perhaps, on a deeper level, predictable as well.  Two adversaries, observing each others swarms, and fighting against the other's swarm might learn things about their counterpart.  Like two fencers sparring, they might learn how the other likes to fight.  Their strategies, their style of moving, their tics.  One might gain an advantage by taking exploiting the habits of one's enemy.   One might also make it more difficult to do so by introducing a bit of randomness to the fight.  I'm imagining a fencer hiring bystanders to jump out of hiding and toss things at their opponent once in a while.  Kick at them.  Distract them.  Make it more difficult to predict the flow of the fight.

Having perfect control over your swarm is an incredible power, but might be a weakness, if it leads to your swarm possessing aspects of behavior that are predictable.

But let's not lose sight of this post's intent - While I was living there there were several acts of random violence that I witnessed. Typically gang related, but there was one point where these teenagers started throwing bricks at women's heads, the NYPD then flooded the area with an officer on every corner for over a week. My car was broken into and there was an area under the GWB where heroin needles were stuck into trees. It was all good as young lad to live there as it was VERY cheap and pretty nice neighborhood.  Trouble for me started when I got a beautiful girlfriend who started living with me - the cat calling and harassment was intense and upsetting to her.  12 year old boys telling her they wanted to fuck the shit out of her and snatching her cell phone. Lived near a Domino's and the drivers would bang on the window when she walked by.  I called corporate office and asked them how one should respond to their wife getting sexually harassed, received free pizza, an apology, and it did cease immediately for all women.

Final straw for me was one afternoon, hearing what sounded like teens fighting right on my door.  Door is rattling and everything.  Waited for it to die down and looked through the peep hole to see my neighbor looking shocked. I opened the door to find a trail of blood from my apartment to a guy laying in a pool of it in the hallway with another guy yelling over him. Police arrived and took him away, murder detectives showed up a few hours later.  The guy was stabbed over a drug deal gone wrong and died. They posted police at my door for the next week or so, and about a month or so later a swat team showed up breaking down another neighbor's door.  That was enough for me to move to Astoria.

So yeah, Washington Heights - beautiful parks, architecture, and scenery.  The dirty secret? It's still a pretty wild neighborhood sometimes. I see it pop up on local news still with shootings and pretty crazy stuff.

1083,3851,3851,bnmu4j,en9hxcc,1,t3_bnmu4j,"I've lived in NYC for over ten years. It has lots of problems and maybe it's a shit hole, but it's *my* shit hole.

Some falsehoods based on assumptions or limited interactions:

*""It’s cramped and smelly and filthy."" —* some areas are, for sure, and there are urban planning problems related to all of that. But many neighborhoods are surprisingly spacious and cleaner than a lot of cities I've been to around the world. There are lots of parks and green areas, more than most other urban centers in America.

*""Everything is cheesy and ridiculously overpriced.""* — sounds like Times Square and tourist locations in Manhattan. Yes I won't lie things are overpriced in a lot of places, but if you know where to go or avoid touristy areas, you can eat a sandwich for $4 or a $1 coffee or find a beer for $5. With regard to trendy food scenes, LA, SF, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, etc are no less expensive for these things, and I've been to all those places to compare. Actually in terms of what is ridiculously overpriced in NY, I'd pretty much say it's real estate, and even then it isn't as bad as SF these days.

*""The drinks are watery and everybody wants a fat tip just for showing up.""* — Depends where you go. There are plenty of bars in the city that are divey, cheap, and will pour drinks that are stiff AF. If you're nice to your bartender they'll probably comp you a drink, it happens all the time.

*""The NYC subway is creaky and busted and full of crazy drug addicts and nasty hood rats that just wanna fight.""* — MTA does have lots of problems and we love to complain about them, but it's the only major system in the world that runs 24/7/365 with as many lines as it has. Also it's gotten a lot cleaner over the years. Occasionally you will see drug addicts and people looking for a fight, but this is not everyday anymore, it's more rare than anything. I'd describe the subway today as full of depressed looking people staring into their phones above all else.

*""Brooklyn is full of insufferable wannabe artists that are posing on Instagram on their way to their pizza jobs.""* — If anything is insufferable, it's this lame ass stereotype. Sure, those people exist, in areas that make up like 10% of Brooklyn. There are so many different types of people here and they don't represent this at all.

I do agree with the notion that the city has driven out a lot of the artists and people who made the city edgy and cool in the first place. It's getting overly gentrified, losing character to more and more high rise condos, whole foods, and apple stores, all of which look the same. It bums me out.

I don't know if I'll stay here forever as I have gotten tired of how expensive real estate is for the little amount of space I get... but I'll tell you why it's been worth it even still, and why I don't think of it as paying more for misery: the city is still vibrant and full of life, feels incredibly diverse, people have a really go-getter hard-work ethic mentality you don't see many other places in the US, there are so many opportunities here if you know how to seize them, night life is still by far the best in America (there's something for everyone, whether you like dance clubs, wine bars, or divey shit holes with pool tables, and everywhere is open way later than the rest of the country), there are so many interesting and open people here worth meeting with insane stories to tell, and I dunno, there is some sort of *je ne sais quoi* in the air, that in spite of all its recent overpriced real estate and homogenous gentrification, it feels like the kind of city where anything wild/interesting/weird/funny/exciting can happen at anytime, and something about that makes me feel alive every single day.",lived nyc ten year lot problem maybe shit hole shit hole falsehood based assumption limited interaction cramped smelly filthy area sure urban planning problem related many neighborhood surprisingly spacious cleaner lot city around world lot park green area urban center america everything cheesy ridiculously overpriced sound like time square tourist location manhattan yes lie thing overpriced lot place know go avoid touristy area eat sandwich coffee find beer regard trendy food scene la sf portland seattle chicago etc le expensive thing place compare actually term ridiculously overpriced ny pretty much say real estate even bad sf day drink watery everybody want fat tip showing depends go plenty bar city divey cheap pour drink stiff af nice bartender probably comp drink happens time nyc subway creaky busted full crazy drug addict nasty hood rat wanna fight mta lot problem love complain major system world run many line also gotten lot cleaner year occasionally see drug addict people looking fight everyday anymore rare anything describe subway today full depressed looking people staring phone else brooklyn full insufferable wannabe artist posing instagram way pizza job anything insufferable lame as stereotype sure people exist area make like brooklyn many different type people represent agree notion city driven lot artist people made city edgy cool first place getting overly gentrified losing character high rise condo whole food apple store look bum know stay forever gotten tired expensive real estate little amount space tell worth even still think paying misery city still vibrant full life feel incredibly diverse people really go getter hard work ethic mentality see many place u many opportunity know seize night life still far best america something everyone whether like dance club wine bar divey shit hole pool table everywhere open way later rest country many interesting open people worth meeting insane story tell dunno sort je ne sais quoi air spite recent overpriced real estate homogenous gentrification feel like kind city anything wild interesting weird funny exciting happen anytime something make feel alive every single day,t3_bnmu4j,1557701698,Negative,-0.02717142857,0.06364285714,0.09482142857,0.8415,671

I went to Miami in March 2019 to visit family for my birthday. Miami was SOOO clean. Not a single shred of trash on the floor. Everywhere smelled so nice and it was so warm down there. That place was magical. 

The day I came back to NY was the worst day of the vacation. I had to go to the city immediately after I landed.

You let me know when I can see the original cast of Hamilton one night and a small, avant-garde black box production the next in Billings, Montana and we'll talk. Yea, shows tour now, but not all do. Two of my favorite Broadway shows are All the Way and Network, both featuring Bryan Cranston, and neither of them touring (the former is an HBO show though). We also get access to shows sooner and have more general variety than your local theater does. This point is insane and dumb.

I was living in Philly in an old row home. We had always had a mouse problem, so when my friend freaked out and said he saw I rat, I assured him that it was but only a small mouse. I was wrong. 
It was Halloween day and I was just getting dressed up ( I was the hulk that year and was wearing the full upper body suit that you can buy-fake muscles and all. I was half done painting my face when I heard an 8 year old girl scream coming from downstairs. I ran down as fast as I could and found my 30 year old roommate bent over on top of the dishwasher in the kitchen screaming that he saw a rat and it was underneath the dishwasher. As I was about to reassure him that it was just a mouse to my horror I see one of our sticky traps slide out from under the washer, turn on an a 90 deg angle, and pull free from a large foot. 
After some intense negotiations, we decided to block off the kitchen with furniture and don a weapon. My roommate grabbed an old set of horizontal blinds thinking to use it like a net. I grab a walking cane. We entered the death arena and kicked the dishwasher. The rat came flying out, it looked more like a small bunny as it hopped to exit the kitchen. Out blockade was a success and soon the beast turned it attention toward us. My friend tried to use the blinds to trap it but the animal used agility and began to charge me. There I was, dressed as the hulk, half painted face and everything went into slow motion. The rat charged me-teeth barred and I swung once with the cane. I missed and the rat began to leap in midair for an assault. I swung with all my might, this was a true max Payne slow mo moment as I connected. The rat fell to the ground and I unleashed my finishing blow with the cane. Hulk smashed...

Pigeons can't really do much damage to a rat, but rats straight up cant kill pigeons in most of their normal spots. Neither animal gets wiped out in round 2. Rats might win round 3 because while pigeons are bigger than rats I don't think pigeons have enough power to actually score kills on a rat. I actually think rats are harsher villains because they can infest homes and can potentially kill high ranking officials. Pigeons can do damage but only until you know they're a problem.. then you can just stay outside. 

Round 1 is the most interesting one because thats actually almost entirely up to how smart the rat king and pigeon king are. How would they ever even find the person behind the other army? Its not like they have to do some big spell or wave their arms around. Even if you had scouts everywhere, you wouldn't even know what to look for. However, if something comes up in their personal life and they use rat/pigeon powers to kill/harm someone, they could potentially track down their enemy using that. But then they'd have to find a way to track the other one down without outting themselves first. They also could both just go to Long Island and be out of each other's kill ranges. When it comes down to a 1v1, I think pigeon person wins just because it sounds like pigeons have an easier time blitzing a grown human than rats do, and while pigeons kill slower than rats there's potential that someone getting mauled by pigeons would no longer be able to control his rats... although again you can do a decent job defending against both just by sitting in your car, and anyone who brings a gun to that fight is probably winning quicker anyway.

And? Hollywood sucks too. It always sucked. If you're expecting to walk around and be dazzled while Frank Sinatra plays in the background you're going to be disappointed. It's just a fucking few blocks in a city, calm down. I've gone to see a few shows and tickets were super affordable and the shows were fantastic. I just don't expect to get $30 Hamilton tickets and see Lin Manuel Miranda act before an audience of ""authentic New Yorkers"".

> The NYC subway is creaky and busted and full of crazy drug addicts and nasty hood rats that just wanna fight

Maybe in a few places, but I go around all of Manhattan and a few of the other boroughs fairly regularly and have never had problems on the subway besides a few smelly people and some people who talk too loudly. No one has ever asked to fight me.

> Also: actual rats.

Also, welcome to every city and basically every area where humans live and throw away food. Next you'll tell me there are roaches and ants!

> And Brooklyn is full of insufferable wannabe artists that are posing on Instagram on their way to their pizza jobs.

DAE hipstur millenealz are annoying? Jesus christ Brooklyn is full of normal people. Maybe there are a lot of artists because Pratt is there? Or because people wealthy enough to own galleries locate them there? If you don't like twenty year olds on their phones, you're going to have a rough rest of your life.

>  I knew New York in the 80's, 90's, 2000's and I know its latest Disneyfied version, which is duller and more of a big dirty mall than anything else

Better than being worried I'll get stabbed while I'm walking home. Don't go to Times Square, Broadway, Empire State Building, or the Chelsea Market and you'll be fine.

> why are they putting up with this shit, 

Because we have jobs located here? Because we have friends and family here? Because if you get your head out of your ass and realize every place has good and bad things about it, you'll find the food you like, the activities you like, and it's close enough to the mountains/beach that you can take a weekend off and do anything that the city doesn't have.

4693,15686,15686,5u718m,ddsh0ji,7,t1_dds64m2,"Well it was a cool summer evening, so my girlfriend and I decided to smoke a bowl and take a walk over to the park. There are a bunch of brownstones near my apartment, and a couple are being heavily renovated. The contractors block off the construction sites by setting up these green wooden boards along the sidewalk. These boards don't sit flush on the sidewalk--there's usually a small gap of a few inches between the cement and the bottom of the board.

Across the street from the construction site is an elementary school, and on this particular evening there was some kind of function at the school. A bunch of kids and parents were spilling out onto the street. It was an unusual number of people for that time of day, so I was distractedly looking across the street as we walked past the construction site.

I had the construction site to my right, my girlfriend to my left. I'm kind of in this stoned daydream when my girlfriend shrieks and jumps about 6 feet in the air. In that same instant I see in my peripheral vision some brown mass emerge from beneath the wooden barrier to the construction site. By the time I looked down this filthy fat fucking rat the size of a small dog has already climbed onto my shin and is hanging on my leg like a koala on a tree.

I kick my leg like I'm doing a bad impression of a Rockette and this fat fuck arcs through the air and lands like a bag of wet sand several feet ahead of me. It somehow squeezes back beneath the wooden barrier. My girlfriend and I run across the street to process this violation.

By some divine providence I was wearing pants rather than shorts. I was wearing light colored khakis, so you could actually see where the rat was. On my shin was a huge skidmark, which must have been from the sebum and grime of the rat's fur. Closer to my knee was this brown wet spot about the size of a quarter. I don't know if that was from the rat's mouth or asshole or what. Those pants went straight into the garbage.

Then I took a scalding hot shower and read about symptoms of rat bite fever for a while.

Round 1: Rat person just has to chill in a basement with no windows (plenty of those around). Pigeons would have a hard time getting in. Rats on the other hand can make their way through anything through small gaps and are excellent in climbing navigating tight passage ways. Only way I see pigeon boy successfully evading the rats is by being in an airship or boat and even then rats have been known to occupy those vehicles. I'd give it to rat boy 7/10  


Round 2: Hmm.. Depends. I can see the pigeons just circling over heads picking off rats one by one. I can also see rats sneak attacking tired pigeons that come to land for a break or food/water. It'll be a battle of attrition. pigeons out number rats two to one but I think the rats are more skilled at surviving winter because they have more places to hide such as subways, buildings, etc. If it drags on until winter rat boy barely manages a win 5.5/10 if not I give it to pigeon boy 7/10  


Round 3: Depends on who can blitzkrieg fast enough. To be honest I can't see a flock of pigeons causing enough bodily harm to kill a human faster than a swarm of rats. There is a lake in central park that pigeon boy can chill in the center of but iirc rats know how to swim. I'd give this to rat boy 6/10  


Bonus: It's a draw. Both can cause millions of deaths easily. For rats you can take the current strain of Covid-19 and modify it so that it becomes more deadly and  transmittable through rat bites, blood, & feces. It will be known as the Black Death 2.0. For pigeons you can do the same such as the bird flu or avian influenza. Let's be a bit more creative though. You can strap anthrax or nerve gas to the pigeons making a wave kamikaze birds who fly through cities killing millions.

3351,8706,8706,hzyt71,fzpb4qq,2,t3_hzyt71,"Round 1: The pigeon man wins, he can cover more ground and get somewhere higher up, rats can't unlock a door and can only really search ground level, pigeons can be anywhere, now, I have two scenarios, 1) they've both had their respective powers for a few years and knew this day would come, Pigeon man builds a harness (supposedly it takes about a thousand pigeons to lift an average person), he also makes a series of harnesses for his pigeons and uses them to fly around, rat-man makes a small fortified platform to ride his rats like a wave, and an arm-mounted rat-a-pult for the hell of it. Pigeon man uses his superior mobility and surveillance to locate and take out Rat-man, Rat-man uses the rat-a-pult to take out a few pigeons and lower the pigeon-man's mobility but is ultimately overwhelmed in the mass descent. 2) they both get their powers and mission that day, and Pigeon man still has the advantage and wins.

&#x200B;

Round 2: same scenarios. I think it's be close, in both 1) Rat-man uses his rat-a-tat-tat-a-pult (I'm not sorry) to launch rats at pigeons, the rats latch onto the pigeons and claw at them until they fall into the churning ocean. As the pigeons dive down in clouds the rats engulf them, but I think in the end, the pigeons would overwhelm them with numbers. Scenario 2) is the same thing but less interesting.

&#x200B;

Round 3: Scenario one: Pigeon-man stood surrounded by his cooing army, cables ran from his torso to two-thousand pigeons around him, a million more hiding in the trees and on surrounding buildings, the rat-man stood at the far end of central Park, a churning ocean of squeaking rodents around him, he sat in his wooden box, a series of small windows around him, he checked the device on his arm and ordered a few rats to climb inside his small defense. The clock struck noon and the armies advanced, a torrent of flapping wings erupted into the sky, the pigeon-man's cables tightened and his feet lifted off the round, the sea of rats advanced, seamlessly pouring around trees as if they were liquid. A cloud of pigeons dived down on the Rat-man's palanquin, Rat-man grabbed a rat and loaded it in his wrist-mounted device, then pulled back on the string, then he fired the rat-a-pult, the rodent twisted in mid-air and sunk its claws and teeth into the avian, dragging it to the ground and ending it, he fired more out the small windows, the rats dragged the pigeons down into the ever-shifting mass. Platoons of Pigeons descended into the fray, pecking and clawing at the rodents, some were dragged down, others pulled rats into the air and dropped them back, cracking grotesquely against other rats, animals on both sides were left wounded and bleeding. While some flocks kept clumps of rats busy others would skim the surface and snatch rats up, dropping them on fence spikes and pavement, though not without wounds of their own. The Pigeon-man watched from above, he saw through the eyes of his avian armada, he was concerned with the loss in number, it was time to take personal action, he gathered all of his pigeons into one giant flock, he positioned himself above Rat-man's transport, the Rat-man also made a change in tactic, his rats climbed on top of themselves, rising up in towers, leaping up and latching onto the avians. The Fleet descended, blocking out the sun, the Pigeon man dropped fast, he crashed through the wooden roof of the vehicle and grabbed the rat-man as the two armies collided like the jaws of a colossal beast, the two rose above the clouds, positioned over the open roads, nothing to cushion the blow, the pigeons surrounded the battlefield to trap the rats, only small amounts able to slip through, the Pigeon-man let go and the rat-man plummeted, he fired off one more rodent from his rat-a-pult, it raked it's claws against the pigeon-man's cheek before it too fell from the sky, he heard the sickening crack of a man against the sidewalk and watched through his feathered friends as the rats forgot their orders and dispersed, fanning out through the city streets, crawling into sewers and trash cans, he relinquished control of his pigeons as he flew over to his apartment, he watched the cloud of pigeons spread over the city, spreading thinner and thinner until it was a normal-looking sky, the streets littered with animal carcasses, the Rat-man's transport sat dormant in the park, broken and abandoned, briefly used as a homeless man's shelter until it was broken up and sold, it was a strange day, a very, very strange day.

&#x200B;

Round Three: Scenario two: same deal, less interesting, Pigeon-man finds Rat-man's hideout simply because he can escape the rats.

&#x200B;

Bonus: I think this is easily the closest, the rats have the fear advantage, I'd imagine more people are scared of rats than by pigeons, and seeing an ocean of rats pouring through the streets. But there are more pigeons, they can blot out the sun and smash high windows, people below hear glass breaking and scatter as it hits the sidewalk, then the birds descend and attack like Alfred Hitchcock.

At the end of the article you linked, it links to some of the empirical studies that have been done, and says that all but one found either a negative relationship or no relationship at all between raising the minimum wage and employment. The reason many of them find no relationship is because (a) many increases in minimum wage aren't enough to 'move the needle,' as in my $9 vs $15 example above, and (b) because there's a lot of illegal labor supply that gets paid below the statutory minimum wage.


Two thought experiments will make this really clear:

(i) Imagine the federal minimum wage law was $0.01, and congress magnanimously decided to raise it to $0.02. Clearly, there would be no effect on total employment.

(ii) Imagine congress decided to raise the minimum wage to $100 an hour. Clearly, there would be a massive decrease in total employment, as many people would choose to fix their own cars, cut their own grass etc. etc. rather than hire people to do it.

I don’t think you are understanding the concept of a classic liberal if you think I’m a big supporter of minimum wages.  I dislike government intervention into any individual’s private lives and businesses.  I view government as a necessary evil, but would like to see it restrained in scope and power, especially where it comes to interfering with individual liberty.  I’m more along the lines of let the gays marry whoever they love, let the country folk shoot their guns and drink their beer, and pretty much just let individuals pursue that which makes them happy in life.  Judging by your attempts to put words in my mouth , I would suspect you’re of a more hardline thinker.

Specific to policies that cities under Democrat leadership have and that I feel are liable for the attitudinal differences, I would suggest that high taxes, heavy-handed business regulation, quirky local laws and regulations, etc have a tendency to drive people who don’t agree out.  Over years, this leads to a population of those who agree politically, and the poor / working-poor that for whatever reason are inclined to stay (low housing costs due to artificial price controls, social services, not knowing anything different, etc).

Don’t get me wrong, I have no issue with the cities governing themselves as they see fit, and if the city population votes for and supports these measures, who am I to complain?  I just dislike being in them, so I choose not to.

Rat Man can hide deep underground somewhere extremely hard for pigeon access, while the rats can get into nearly anything and will cover more ground working their way up from underground. Pigeon Person's pigeons are unlikely to locate Rat Man and unless Pigeon Person creates an impenetrable barrier around himself to protect himself from the millions of rats coming his way once he's promptly found and creates a scenario where Rat Man is lured out to try and kill Pigeon Person himself, and it becomes a game of Rat Man using his information of Pigeon Person's location to manipulate a situation where Pigeon Person's barrier is disrupted without being detected. It will be hard to avoid detection in this unlikely scenario, in which case the pigeons will peck him to the bone while his surely fierce squad of rats won't be able to save a singular human from an unrelenting aerial assault. Rat Man 8/10

Round 2: Assuming the stand users can only control the animals to the natural extent of their capabilities, this battle comes down to siege warfare. While the rat certainly has a fierce bite and could disable a pigeon easily should they come to blows, the pigeons flying ability prevents the rat from engaging on its own terms. With this advantage, Pigeon Man forces a stalemate. With flight and a 2:1 numbers advantage, the pigeons can easily surveil the largest food sources of the rats; garbage around the city. Most of which is above ground so the rats must expose themselves to eat. The Pigeons have an easier time getting food from natural sources that are more easily available to them. It all comes down to whether Pigeon Man can use his numbers and flight advantage to bully the rats away from their food. Pigeon Man utilizes his flight and numbers advantage to enact a 3:1 engagement strategy against any rats seen trying to get food. But the rat is fierce indeed, and takes down at least one pigeon with it. As the numbers dwindle at an almost even pace, the ratio at which the pigeons outnumber the rats increases. A certain point is reached where the pigeons can no longer effectively surveil enough food sources that the rats can scurry between. This forces the pigeons to chase the rats into their natural environments of claustrophobic spaces, where the rat has a massive advantage, to try and finish them off. Rat Man 6/10

R3: Assumes battle is decided when either stand user dies. Rat Man consolidates all his rats together to form a menacing mass of two million rats with him at the center and moves forward. The mass is spread thinly enough so that he isn't crushed under the weight. Pigeon Person sends forth his terrifying fleet of pigeons and before long they're above the rat mass. Before they knew what was happening, the Rat Man and his army were greeted with bird droppings that came with the thunderous sound of a heavy rain. However, being NYC rats, it had little to no effect considering they're well acclimated to being covered in shit and piss. Pigeon Person knew this would be the case but he figured, ""*it'd be funny*"". It certainly pissed off Rat Man. Now covered in fecal matter, the Rat Mass presses on towards its target. The maelstrom of pigeons and rats around Rat Man measures several dozen meters, but he presses on with every rat focused on defending the mass. Can the Rat Mass get to Pigeon Person before it's whittled down?

I want you to have to take it out of the deep-freeze freezer, you’ll actually have to put it in the microwave just to take it down a bit, just a couple of degrees, to where it’s still way too cold to touch, I still can’t lick it, I’d still get a major ice-burn on my tongue if I attempted premature contact.

And then I want the spoon to be warmed up, not in a microwave, obviously, you can’t put metal in the microwave. Maybe I could find some sort of a composite spoon? All right, give me a spoon made out of the same material they make hockey sticks and golf clubs. I want it to be light, like ultra lightweight, so now OK, you can go ahead and throw it in the microwave for a minute or two.

If you haven’t already, you should go ahead and buy two microwaves, because I don’t want to wait around while you’re messing with different power level settings for the ice cream and for the spoon. I want them both to be warming up at the same exact time.

All of my soda has to be ice cold too. Also, the carbonation has to be really powerful. But more importantly, really, really cold. But only slightly less important, the carbonation. Don’t talk to me about freezing points, I want a colder-than-ice Coca-Cola that somehow hasn’t turned into a block of ice. I’ve seen it done before, it was science class in high school, or a science TV show that the science teacher showed us on one of those days where she didn’t feel like teaching, it was something about not disturbing the liquid, or putting something inside of it, and it’ll stay liquid.

You know that sensation you get when you first take a sip of a really ice cold drink? Like you can feel it working its way down your esophagus? I want that with every sip, not just the first. And I don’t want to feel it just in my esophagus, I want to feel it all the way down, snaking its way through my intestines, that refreshing feeling chilling a path throughout my whole digestive system.

My soup also has to be really cold. I don’t care what time of year you’re supposed to traditionally eat gazpacho, I’d like it in January, February, if there’s an unseasonably cold stretch through March or April, I’m going to order gazpacho then also, along with other summertime soups, watermelon bisque … I can’t think of any other cold soups, but I know they’re out there, and again, ice cold, I want you to serve me a whole tube of Sensodyne as an appetizer, something to really numb up my gums, I want to hold a big mouthful and really let my whole head cool off.

Iced coffee, iced tea, ice, ice cold. And don’t bother with the regular ice cubes. I want ice cubes made out of iced coffee and iced tea. It has to be cold brewed, by the way. I don’t want anything that’s ever been heated up. I mean, yes, to some extent, I’m always going to have to acknowledge the fact that the earth was formed out of a ball of cooling molten rock, but that’s just it, it’s cooling, it’s getting there.

My favorite planet is Pluto. My favorite sport is ice hockey. If I got to choose a superpower, it would definitely be ice powers. Then I wouldn’t have to worry about talking about any of this nonsense. Give me a hot soup, go ahead, I’ll ice you dead in your tracks, that hot soup’s never going to make it over to my table. And then next idiot server who even thinks about sending over another bowl, he’s going to think again. He’s going to bring me the coldest one they’ve got. And then – zap! – ice powers to make it even colder, and I’ll be able to take it, no frost-burn, no Sensodyne, just straight up cold, colder than all of the Coors Light in the Rockies.

Because seriously, I can’t emphasize enough, I really like my stuff cold. Make sure you tell the chef, because I’ve got a thermometer right here. I’m going to use it, and I’m going to send it back.

Companies that issue tokens and provide bank-like services notwithstanding, I can't go get a loan from Bitcoin, Inc. nor can I get a mortgage from Big Bitcoin.

You're conflating the term banking with currency and liquidity. There was currency before there were banks, many different kinds of it. You're also confusing the ""macroeconomics textbook"" platonic ideal of banking with banks and banksters irl. 

Banks provide liquidity (to some, very conditionally) and do keep money safe (in theory, with the cooperation of a government which can print money at will). Beyond that, banks engage in predatory lending practices, insider information trading with both other major market actors and the government, and are a key pillar of the inflationary federal-bank backed petrodollar system which air-drops currency to privileged actors and manipulates the economy/credit cycle at will. 

Bitcoin does none of that sinister shit. Its inflation rate is hardcoded. It can't be manipulated by the powerful by traditional means. No one can delete your balance because you're a ""bad actor"" in the eyes of the government.

This is (or was)  the culture and the practice of cryptocurrency before all these twee ICOs started coming out promising to bank the unbanked and be exactly like the status quo except plus blockchain. 

So your assertion that banking = the original crypto is wrong on several levels.

She knows her time on this Earth is short and so she has traveled for days to come to this very spot at this very time.  I shift my eyes from hers to those of her pups.  They seem to be in much better shape then their mom.  I realize that she has been giving all of her food and water to her pups in an effort to ensure their survival even at the cost of her own.

  Our eyes meet again and a moment of understanding is shared between myself and her.  ""I have traveled for many days over many miles. You are the chosen one, the one that our legends have spoken of for years"".  I listen intently for what words come next ""You are to raise my children for I am no longer able to"".  I am taken back by this because I have three cats and hate dogs.  ""But how?"" I ask her, not sure that I am up to the task.  She seems to smile a little before saying ""come here and I will teach you"".  I get on my hands and knees, trying with all I have to imitate the mother wolf for the sake of the little pups.

There is something for literally everyone in the city. Easy to traverse either on food, public trans or the many readily available cabs/uber/lyfts.

To me, those ones seem primarily about disabling the man controlling the army of vermin -- incapacitate him, and he can no longer control his animals.

Pigeons are faster than rats, so I could see them winning R3 quite easily by just rushing Ratman before his rodent army reaches Pigeonman. Even if they're weak individually, 4 million birds can confuse Ratman into losing control within seconds, and crush/shred him in minutes.

In R1, a smart Ratman could counter the birds' speed advantage by hiding indoors until his swarm can reach Pigeonman. But Pigeonman could do the same, turning the fight into a protracted espionage situation. To me, the winning strategy for both men would be dispersing their swarm to track their opponent, and then either swarming him, or -- if it's allowed -- poisoning might be highly effective. Rats have the advantage in stealth, so I'd give this one to Ratman if he plays his cards well. But it'd really be a tossup based on who is found first, far from a guaranteed win.

2 million birds matches the rats with 2 million auxiliary birds as support.

To increase population at rapid rates and to provide supplies of all kinds. Mainly dynamite which is easy to create.

Beyond that, mobility wins wars, birds are essentially unkillable by the rats unless they engage in fang to beak combat. Which they won’t be.

The birds will use their massive numbers to locate and firebomb the city. If rats try to hide in sewers or buildings, to that I say GOOD.

Gas lines will be funneled into the sewers and detonated.

I just don't follow this train of thought. Kill the poor? Rent controlled units are less than 2% of stock. Rent stabilized units can hike the rent up by 10% between tenants.

A rat king is a collection of rats whose tails are intertwined and bound together by one of several possible mechanisms, such as entangling material like hair or sticky substances like sap or gum. The number of rats joined together varies from a few to as many as 32. Historically, the phenomenon is particularly associated with Germany, which produced many reported instances. Rat kings occur so rarely that they have sometimes been thought to be cryptids, but there are several well-attested modern occurrences.

 NYC is not for everyone. It's definitely dirty af and there's rats/pigeons/roaches everywhere. One joke we have is about those scented candles that smell like states, ""the scent of New York!"" - clearly these people didn't live in the city ha! I wish it was clean like Toronto or Singapore (well...Singapore may be too clean but I digress) but it's a microcosm of America and it's issues: lack of funding for infrastructure, maintenance + lack of giving a fuck from its residents. And yes, it's absurdly expensive to the point where I'm paying for half of a tiny apartment for more money than my friend in Austin pays for a house.

It's all about what you value. I don't need a lot of space and dirty streets don't bother me all that much, especially compared to what I get in return:

1. Nightlife. I love being able to walk outside my apartment on any night of the week and grab a drink, see a live band, get amazing food, etc (before corona of course)

2. Food. There's far more articles that explain this better than I can, but the food is legendary. I've had ramen better than I've bad in Tokyo. I've had tacos that a friend from Mexico has insisted were better than any he's had from his home. Pizza? Pfft. No contest. 

3. Diversity. Not just food but the people as well. You can learn so much from the various backgrounds, cultures, stories you hear from people you run into. I've danced with multi-millionaires and had heart to hearts with people who have been homeless. Learned about people's religions and cultures just being at a bar. It's an amazing experience that very few cities can give you. 

4. Hobbies. You want to learn extreme trapeze photography? There's a class in NYC for that. The amount of classes you can try out, skills you can pick up, exercises you can try is truly mind boggling. It's amazing. Anyone who lives here for a while I highly HIGHLY recommend taking a class or two of some sort - cooking, sailing, yoga, dancing, martial arts you name it NYC has a class for it.

5. Culture & Exploration. Museums, Broadway, opera, lectures, poetry, comedy shows, parks, botanical gardens, art galleries, parades, farmers markets...the list goes on forever. There's so much to do and see on a random day (before corona) that even if you have no intention of actually going to any of these places that day, you may end up there anyway just out of curiosity. Just spend a day with the only plan is walking around and exploring an area of New York and see where you end up.

In economics, the money supply (or money stock) is the total value of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time. There are several ways to define ""money"", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions).

Money supply data are recorded and published, usually by the government or the central bank of the country. Public and private sector analysts have long monitored changes in the money supply because of the belief that it affects the price level, inflation, the exchange rate and the business cycle.

We got sandwiches at Molinari’s in North Beach (little Italy) and hung out in Washington Park on a blanket in the sun surrounded by music, people, and pups.

Then we walked across Columbus St. and got a glass of wine and sat outside people watching on an outdoor patio listening to live music being played on the street. 

Then, we walked over to China Town and bought some exotic fruits and went tea tasting ($35 for two). Fireworks were going off. Asian people everywhere hustling and bustling in the seemingly endless markets filled with culturally authentic foods and trinkets. 

It was a fantastic and cheap Saturday that was super easy and relaxing. We took in tons of local culture and had we been more ambitious, we could have experienced more. 

Try doing that *anywhere* else in America. It’s almost impossible. THAT’S why SF is so popular. I suppose if you just go to work and back to your expensive apartment, yeah it might seem over rated. 

I live in a house with 4 other roommates (as does my GF) but it’s just the way things are here now and we enjoy it. I love this city more than anyone I know. Is it changing? Of course. Is it hard to live here at times? Absolutely. Would I want to live anywhere else? Absolutely not.

Sure, you might start small and oversee the world's most expansive urban microfarm with your tiny agrarian rats. This would enable you to feed your rat population, and make enough to also arm an army? A tiny flak cannon costs money, as does the tiny uniform of the rat operating it.

With the ability to now feed a population and an ability to penetrate the entire city ad finitum, you could instruct a portion of your tiny slaves to pilfer tiny amounts of copper from the insides of wall cavities to sell for more pigeon-killing reserves.

While digging through the walls and inner workings of one of the most influential cities in the world, you discover that you have created one of the most extensive surveillance and information gathering networks to have ever existed. This puts China to shame. Now the billions of tiny rat paws aren't dealing in copper wire and lost coins, they're carefully listening and transcribing the behind-closed doors trade secrets, the stock tips, the crypto wallet passwords, even the voting intentions of every person in New York. In less than a year, you have created your own tiny rat Stasi. 

While many would think the pigeon society could operate an equally-omnipotent intelligence operation, the sheer fact that rat's are naturally at home in the cramped dank cavitiestof the city gives them a dominace that ariel superiority can't match. 

The most significant reason why rats would ultimately win the lifelong aggression against the flying rats is that tiny paws can dig and turn soil, and hold tiny watering cans, and eventually, operate tiny combine harvesters more readily than a wing can.

In fact, taken a step further, the reality is that those who work is powerful positions in banks are self-interested. Having self-interested individuals run powerful institutions that pull the geopolitical strings of our age is dangerous.

I'm interested on what your metric is for defining the best or worst countries. 

Countries with a high quality of life have such because of economic freedom, not banking. Equating the two is a flaw. 

Now don't get me wrong, I think banks can be wonderful institutions. They're important. But I'd be a proponent of public banking. I don't think banks should make a profit for managing the currency flow or holding the funds of individuals. Such services are so integral to economic freedom, and therefore to the overall quality of life, in a given nation state that I think it's in the interest of the state to provide those services through taxes that are paid. Loans should still incur interest, the total of which could be put back in to state spending. 

But I think you're missing the bigger point. The advent of cryptocurrencies has opened up a dialogue that many people would have never even considered. Can we separate tokens of value from the state in which they're exchanged? Can we force oligarchial financial institutions to provide a fairer and more transparent service by scaring them into action? Can we create a system whereby people can create value without being charged for it? Yes we can. We can with decentralized tokens of value that rely on a transparent, secure and immutable ledger to broadcast activity.

Even the number difference doesn't make up for the fact that hollow bones on the pigeon mean that pigeons are too fragile win against a rat, even in greater numbers. You could look up videos of rats taking down pigeons, and Tierzoo has a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0KOEd34Mb8&t=627s) on the city meta that ranks pigeons in D Tier and Rats in S Tier.

R1 - The pigeon has that best chance in this round due to pigeons being great scouts, as other people have pointed out. However, once the pigeon guy finds rat guy, then what? How does he win in a straight up fight when pigeons are like flying paper mache bobble heads? Not to mention that rat guy's best chance is to just wait things out in the sewers, a place where a pigeon's flight is completely neutralized. Yeah, pigeon guy can potentially fly, but you've gotta land sometime. And rat guy will be there.

R2 - Rats win even easier. Imagine the first seen of IT where Pennywise drags the little kid into the sewer to be devoured. Now make him a rat. 

R3 - Rats take it again. Pigeon guy MIGHT have a chance if he uses the pigeons in a bomber style to drop rocks on rats, but I don't see that being effective when rats can just burrow underground. Even Central Park has sewers.

I live on a street with a full tree canopy overhead, I'm less than a minute walk from a huge park with wide open fields, forests, and ponds, as well as sports facilities for soccer, baseball, football, tennis, ice hockey, etc. I'm also less than a minutes walk from a subway that can take me to the heart of the city in 20 minutes, or to the beach in 20 minutes. Most things I ever need are available within walking distance. 

In the summer there are free outdoor concerts, theatre, and other performances pretty much every day somewhere in the city, often by popular artists that usually charge big bucks for tickets. There are countless museums, and some of the most important collections are completely free to see. There is a scene for pretty much any type of art or music.

There is a community for pretty much any language or culture in the world, meaning that there are restaurants and shops representing most any cultures in the world. 

Bars and clubs are open until 4am, and there are after hours places for those drug addled partiers that need to keep it going until the middle of the next day. In the summer you can even go to parties hosted by the museum of modern art, with great live music, booze, and art installations. 

Kids have access to great public schools, and can choose between a variety of high schools. You don't have to worry about your kid dying in a drunk driving accident, because at worst they pass out drunk on the subway.

You also don't have to worry much about crime, because it is among the safest cities in the country.

There is a specialty store for pretty much anything as well, whether its for your hobby or your profession. 

It isn't for everyone, and it is a very competitive place—but people who are passionate and ambitious don't want to be a big fish in a small pond, they want to be around others who stimulate their passion and push them further in it. 

Clearly there is a reason why more people actually choose to live there than anywhere else in the US.",rat live everywhere last time checked live street full tree canopy overhead le minute walk huge park wide open field forest pond well sport facility soccer baseball football tennis ice hockey etc also le minute walk subway take heart city minute beach minute thing ever need available within walking distance summer free outdoor concert theatre performance pretty much every day somewhere city often popular artist usually charge big buck ticket countless museum important collection completely free see scene pretty much type art music community pretty much language culture world meaning restaurant shop representing culture world bar club open hour place drug addled partiers need keep going middle next day summer even go party hosted museum modern art great live music booze art installation kid access great public school choose variety high school worry kid dying drunk driving accident worst pas drunk subway also worry much crime among safest city country specialty store pretty much anything well whether hobby profession everyone competitive place people passionate ambitious want big fish small pond want around others stimulate passion push clearly reason people actually choose live anywhere else u,t3_bx2nfy,1559767596,Positive,0.36741875,0.152625,0.0350625,0.81225,369

No, it is not, virtually no places are up for both rent and sale at the same time, and no place is sold and rented at the exact same time; the data to do a perfectly fair comparison simply isn't there. What real estate companies do is model the expected rent/sale price of a property given the sale/rent price, but the circular reasoning in that process is pretty obvious. 

I've seen places virtually identical to mine that are owned by an individual and they are considerably nicer. But real estate companies can't quantify how ""nice"" a place is, so my place and the owned places would be price modeled the same.

This could manifest in two primary ways, they could bootstrap their own intelligence by forming a hive mind, composed of both their own intelligence and a percentage of cognitive capacity added for each rat/pigeon added to their swarm.  Or each master could give their swarm general goals they know fit their swarm's natural skills and problem solving set, letting them find unexpected solutions on their own.  Or their powers could synergize between these two options.

I think the pigeons would do better than expected.

> When a central bank is ""easing"", it triggers an increase in money supply by purchasing government securities on the open market thus increasing available funds for private banks to lend out through fractional-reserve banking (the issue of new money through loans) and thus the amount of bank reserves and the monetary base rise. By purchasing government bonds (e.g., U.S. Treasury bills), this bids up their prices, so that interest rates fall at the same time that the monetary base increases.
