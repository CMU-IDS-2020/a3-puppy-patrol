    """
Rats are nocturnal and usually stay within 450 feet of their burrows, which are often in apartment floorboards, alleyways, vegetation, sidewalks or basements. Rats tend to look for places that provide them with food, water, shelter and safe ways for them to get around. 

They live in colonies of around 40‚Äì50 members and can be seen travelling in herds, passing
down successful feeding paths to younger generations. Solitary rats, especially those found during the day, have often been displaced from their burrows.

Like humans, NYC rats are highly intelligent, have daily routines, communicate with one another, and have their own social order. 

> ‚ÄúA rat is so smart they notice when something new enters their environment and are highly suspicious. For example, older rats won‚Äôt eat a new food source. They‚Äôll leave it out for the younger ones to see if they die from eating it. Only then will they venture out to try it.‚Äù - Bill Swan, rat specialist and co-owner of NYC Pest Control in Brooklyn.

Rats have an extremely high rate of reproduction, mating up to 20 times in 6 hours. A female rat
produces 4‚Äì7 litters of around 10 rats each year. Studies indicate New York is particularly well-suited for rats due to sanitation practices, climate, housing construction standards and more.

Rats actively avoid cats, and the researchers only recorded two rat kills in 79 days. The findings add to growing evidence that any benefit of using cats to control city rats is outweighed by the threat they pose to birds and other urban wildlife.</td>

The data shows that NYC residents find dark humor in the prevalence of and size of rats but would love to see them gone. The problem is widespread all across the city, but trends towards Brooklen and Manhattan, which are also hotspots for trash output. 

However, optimistically, the data shows that De Blasio's $32 million plan is correlated with a decrease in rat sightings! NYC should keep doing what it's been doing in the past few years.

Although rats have become part of the fabric of NYC‚Äôs environment and have unprecedented levels of internet fame, most New Yorkers would be glad to see them go. However, this is still an ongoing war with no end in sight, and rats are a formidable enemy.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a never-ending battle, but it‚Äôs the right thing to do,‚Äù said Joseph J. Lhota, former deputy mayor and rat czar, ‚ÄúNever, never, never give up‚Ä¶ People are disgusted by rats.‚Äù
