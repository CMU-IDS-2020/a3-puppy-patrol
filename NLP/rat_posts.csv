I didn't like the density. But friends and gf convinced me to give it another chance and this week we had a free place to stay. After 2 days of living like a new Yorker I gotta say...
What an absolute disgusting city this is. The entire city might as well be a landfill that people pay too much to live in.

Everything is too small, I feel like I'm living in some dystopian future mega city where over population has gone to soylent green levels. 
Everything is over priced. The food, the drinks, even the fucking water. A 6 pack of bud lite and a bottle of regular, filtered water cost me 30 fucking dollars. Some under cooked, yet burnt hamburger was $25. What the fuck is this city made of? Gold? No, its made of fucking trash. 
Everything is old. The apartment we stayed had a shower that looked a fucking roman relic. The microwave was so old that I felt like it was cooking my insides just as much as the food.
The trash, this city is a fucking landfill. The subway is a fucking rat infested sewer fill with homeless people. Oh and the homeless people, they're all crazy, unhinged, and violent psychopaths. 
I looked up property prices here because I'm looking for a housing investment and what a fucking shit show. A studio condo is Chelsea is 750k, not including monthly HOA. I mean I fucking knew NY was expensive but this on a whole another level. Fuck, you couldn't pay me to live here.

Shit, no wonder so many comic book villains are constantly trying to destroy ny. after living here for a week I would too!

Edit: thought i give out some perspective. I live in DC,  and I love it. It's no mega city but its no means the county side. I don't hate big cities in general, I've been to/lived in Boston, LA, Miami, Beijing, Tokyo and thought they were fine. But seriously, fuccccccck NYC

Edit2: Jesus fucking christ people. I didn't buy the Bud Lite, I just noticed the price. What I actually brought was   Peroni. Bud Lite is a lot easier to spell for dyslexic like me.

Everybody loves to love the Big Apple, but it’s not that special. It’s cramped and smelly and filthy. Most of the “historic charm” are tenement buildings that used to be slums that got converted into hipster condos. All the real New Yorkers who used to make New York edgy and full of character can’t afford to live in New York. Everything is cheesy and ridiculously overpriced. The drinks are watery and everybody wants a fat tip just for showing up. Also, everything is either busted or under construction. Even Broadway sucks. You can see great shows anywhere in the world now. The NYC subway is creaky and busted and full of crazy drug addicts and nasty hood rats that just wanna fight. Also: actual rats. And Brooklyn is full of insufferable wannabe artists that are posing on Instagram on their way to their pizza jobs. 

So you can have New York. Place smells like ass.

EDIT: To the supposed ""New York Insiders"" who accuse me of being a tourist, never having left Times Square, or that I just don't know the right ""cool"" neighborhoods: Yeah, that must be it. I just haven't found the next Greenpoint yet, or whatever. Bitches, I am OLD. I knew New York in the 80's, 90's, 2000's and I know its latest Disneyfied version, which is duller and more of a big dirty mall than anything else. I still come to New York almost monthly for work. And I can hack the city just fine. Spent most of life living in cities of over 5 million people. Just some cities function better than others, and New York is not one of them. After a while, one has to ask themselves, why are they putting up with this shit, and paying double for the misery and the stench?"

I will try to list them in chronological order. I am trying to make this list to be as detailed and comprehensive as possible, so although I am including things that some may argue are “small” or “petty,” please do not think I am trying to equate them with the overall bigger issues with Jeffree Star; his racism, sexism, classism and overall violent demeanor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I most likely forgot something. Please let me know below and I will add it to the body of this post!

&#x200B;

To Start: Who is Jeffree Star?

&#x200B;

Jeffree Star is an internet personality and beauty brand owner from Orange County, CA. Jeffree got his start at internet fame in the early 2000s on MySpace. Around 2006, he began releasing music and garnered a large following online. In 2009 he released his first and only album, Beauty Killer. He had a lot of success at first, joining Warped Tour and working with artists like Akon, but he abruptly left the music scene in 2013. About a year later in 2014, Jeffree launched his brand “Jeffree Star Cosmetics” with a line of liquid lipsticks. Jeffree started posting YouTube videos to promote his new brand and eventually expanded to posting other beauty related videos as well. His YouTube channel and brand have since become extremely successful and in 2019, Jeffree Star Cosmetics is a multi-million dollar company and Jeffree’s YouTube channel has over 16 million subscribers.

&#x200B;

Now, let's get into what makes Jeffree Star so controversial.

&#x200B;

\- This video is a compilation of Jeffree Star using racial slurs. One video in particular shows Jeffree violently yelling at women walking down the street calling them “n\*\*\*\*\*.” This footage can be traced back to 2004-2006, and Jeffree would have been 19-21 years old at the time.   [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DbXafcp_ZA&utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&app=desktop)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-In an infamous ‘skit’ Jeffree did back in 2006, Jeffree and a friend made “jokes” about using battery acid to lighten a black woman's skin tone.""You say black folk cannot wear MAC Cosmetics, and then you splashed acid in her face."" ""Well maybe if she wasn't wearing the wrong foundation color, I wouldn't have HAD to splash no battery acid to lighten her skin tone, girl.""   [Skit starts at 3 minute mark](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4l67gr)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-In 2009, Jeffree called Tila Tequila a “whore,” in an interview. He was asked if his lifestyle would be possible without the internet, to which he replied “me and that whore, Tila Tequila, are the ones that capitalized on it. Her and I used to be friends but I am not into people that think they have to be like, naked all the time. You don’t have to prostitute yourself to be successful.” Although Tila Tequila has a history of being problematic herself; one could argue that Jeffree’s comment speaks to his hatred for women, especially those who express their sexuality. [Interview](https://laist.com/2008/03/10/jeffree_star_interview.php)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-In 2013, Dahvie Vanity of the band Blood On The Dance Floor was accused of sexually assaulting underage girls. Back when Jeffree was still making music, he had collaborated with BOTDF and spent time with them on Warped Tour. After these accusations came out, Jeffree tweeted “I’m gonna speak the truth til I die. We saw @botdfmusic Dahvie bring under age girls to his hotel rooms an do sexual things. 100% ILLEGAL.” This clearly shows that Jeffree was aware of what was happening, that it was illegal, and yet still was complicit. Later that year, Jeffree tweeted that he had “so much love” for Dahvie, and Dahvie replied saying that Jeffree apologized to his face for making the false accusations. So either 1. Jeffree sat back while his friend raped underage girls, then later “forgave him” for this. or 2. Jeffree made false accusations against a former friend. Either situation is telling of how truly problematic Jeffree is. [Relevant article about Dahvie that references Jeffree's accusations](https://medium.com/cuepoint/warped-behavior-sexual-violence-on-tour-8ad218d50bc9) ; [Dahvie saying Jeffree apologized for the 'false accusations'](https://twitter.com/thedarkartsco/status/404704851629584384) ; [Jeffree showing love and support for Dahvie, months after accusing him of being a rapist](https://twitter.com/JeffreeStar/status/404699255203328000)

\-EDIT: After looking into this again, 'Dahvie Vanity' is absolutely guilty, so Jeffree did not lie about the accusations. He did, however, double down on the accusations and go back to being friends with a rapist. Just this month, Huffington Post put out an article detailing the accusations against Dahvie Vanity, which involves at least 21 women. You can read that [here](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dahvie-vanity-botdf-sexual-assault_n_5c82afb8e4b0d9361627ca1f).

&#x200B;

\- In 2016, after the release of Jeffree’s skin frost highlighters, a fan/YouTuber by the name of RockyRoadkill uploaded a video about his experience with the product. The title was arguably clickbaity, but the content of the video revealed that Rocky was a huge fan of Jeffree’s that waited in line at DragCon to be one of the first to purchase the Skin Frost. When Rocky opened the compact, the highlighter pan was not glued down, and the entire pan fell out and shattered. Rocky went on to email customer service, who said they would not refund him or replace his product because he purchased it at DragCon. Overall, the video was civil. Rocky was still a fan of Jeffree’s and still wanted to try the product, despite the bad experience. Jeffree, who clearly did not watch the video, commented on Rocky’s social media saying “Instead of emailing my customer service or reaching out to me personally, you make a slander video? How pathetic. You’re desperate for views and attention. My customer service team would of happily sent you a replacement or refunded you. You failed to contact them. We will be reaching out to YouTube about this defamation.” One could chalk this up to a simple misunderstanding, but Jeffree’s tendency to immediately attack anyone who criticizes him is telling.  [Relevant article with screenshots](https://www.justinj1232.com/not-so-fast-jeffree-star-clapsback-at-youtube-vlogger-for-makeup-review/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-In 2016, Jeffree Star and MakeupShayla got in an argument that resulted in Jeffree calling Shayla a “c\*\*\*,” and threatening to “beat her into the ground.” Jeffree and Shayla both attending an Urban Decay event in Las Vegas, where Jeffree alleges that Shayla told another beauty influencer, Mariale, that she needed lip filler because her face looked deformed. Jeffree apparently was so upset about this that he later took to Twitter and called Shayla names. Shayla denied the accusations. Jeffree said “I’ll actually beat you to the fucking ground and mean it.”  Shayla went on to tweet that you should never support a man that threatens to beat a woman, and Jeffree replied “but you look and sound like more a man than I do...so relax.” He also went on to call Shayla a ""broke fucking rat."" [Relevant article with screenshots](https://bglh-marketplace.com/2016/05/jeffree-star-threatens-to-beat-up-beauty-guru-makeupshayla/) ; [Screenshots](https://images.app.goo.gl/vLa8JLHt9Pwxrytj9)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-In 2017, Jackie Aina posted an anti-haul where she anti-hauled Jeffree Star’s entire brand, saying she could not support his brand because of previous racism and how he attacked Shayla. Jeffree responded by blocking Jackie on Twitter and calling her an “irrelevant rat,” and eventually tweeting that she “hasn’t paid her taxes in three years.” Although it has been argued that ""rat"" is not an inherently racist term; please note that Jeffree has only ever used this term to describe black women. [Screenshot of tweet about Jackie's taxes](https://images.app.goo.gl/U7iQn2PueTWyTUvM8) ; [Screenshot of tweet calling Jackie an ""irrelevant rat""](https://images.app.goo.gl/gkfbsU3zB9f4SKNK9) ; [Revelist article](https://www.revelist.com/beauty-news-/jeffree-star-jackie-aina/8146/back-to-the-present-star-in-a-nowdeleted-tweet-called-aina-an-irrelevant-rat/6)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-Also in 2017, Jeffree went on a Twitter crusade against Too Faced’s then owner Jerrod Blandino. He took things too far when he began to hint that Too Faced mistreated NikkieTutorials when they collaborated with her on a palette in 2016. Jeffree tweeted that Nikkie was “suffering in silence,” and went on to give a statement to Here For The Tea that said “Her and I are no longer friends. You can confirm that. But I still respect her hustle and I watched first hand how they abused her and know how much she got paid. It's embarrassing. I think anyone else BUT me would be afraid to mention the contract. I did it to make a statement and so the audience has a taste as to WHY the palette was so sh\*tty. She approved something and what was produced was not the same quality.” Nikkie never came forward and addressed this. Jeffree’s fans argue that he did this with Nikkie’s best interest in mind; but seeing as they are no longer friends, he did not ask her permission before exposing this AND Jeffree’s statement reads a bit self congratulatory- one could argue that Jeffree only did this for his own gain and did not consider how this might affect Nikkie and her business relationships. [Relevant article with screenshots](https://www.allure.com/story/jeffree-star-calls-out-jerrod-blandino)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-In September 2018, Jeffree's ex hairstylist, Daved, released text messages where Jeffree calls Jackie Aina a ""gorilla,"" among other racial slurs. Although the validity of these texts has been debated, there is some circumstantial 'proof.' First, Daved posted a video where he scrolls through the message thread which proves that these are not fabricated screenshots, though it does not prove who the messages are from. Furthermore, the content of the messages (asking why Jeffree unfollowed him, Jeffree talking about Daved doing Jackie's hair, etc) further imply that it is a conversation between Daved and Jeffree. The date is 2017, so in order for the texts to be fake, Daved would've been planning this for over a year which seems totally implausible. Lastly, Daved himself was racially insensitive and complicit with Jeffree’s behavior in the messages. Daved basically called himself out by releasing these, which makes it even less likely that he did this for his own gain. [Video of Daved scrolling through the texts with Jeffree](https://twitter.com/lizjomo/status/1043336624153587712) ; [Relevant article with more details](https://collegecandy.com/2018/09/26/jeffree-star-jackie-aina-daved-scissorhands-munoz-racism-texts-receipts/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-In October 2018, Jeffree was called out for being culturally insensitive yet again when he wore cornrows for a Jeffree Star Cosmetics photo shoot. When he received backlash on Twitter, a fan defended him by saying "" Girl, it’s not cultural appropriation. I’m black and I don’t have an issue with it and neither does anyone in my family or my friends. All I see are white people having an issue with it. It’s HAIR. There are people dying in other countries and you’re mad about HAIR? #cantrelate."" Jeffree replied to this fan with "" Hahaha preach!!! young kids trying to be mad at something always."" Instead of maybe reassessing his actions and apologizing to fans, Jeffree went on to defend himself and accuse upset fans of trying to find something to be mad about.  [Photo of Jeffree in cornrow braids](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://preview.redd.it/8h6n9b6ud7p11.jpg?width%3D1024%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc28ed5f673fddc969cdd82e5621a02eda1444a3d&imgrefurl=https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/9jy8gb/jeffree_wears_cornrows_to_his_houston_meet_and/&docid=94IQySoANM_4hM&tbnid=GXmUAdQM0f2JiM:&vet=1&w=1024&h=576&hl=en-us&source=sh/x/im) ; [Relevant article](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/jeffree-star-cornrows-cultural-appropriation-braids)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-Also in October 2018, Jeffree accused Huda Kattan of Huda Beauty of copying Beauty Bakerie's concept for their setting powders. He went on to post screenshots of private messages between he and Huda, said Huda Beauty should ""fuck off,"" and accused her of being a thief. Although it has been argued whether Huda stole the idea; this situation once again shows Jeffree's obsession with ""exposing"" other brands and influencers under the guise of ""being honest."" It couldn't be more obvious that it is an attempt to get attention and make himself look like the hero, rooting for the poor underdog.

Please feel free to share this post, correct me on anything I may have had wrong, or add more in the comments. I'll update this post as necessary. Thanks guys!

&#x200B;

Edit also sorry for the formatting skskskks

&#x200B;

\*\*\*edited to add\*\*\*

&#x200B;

\-[Lyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jeffreestar/wewantcunt.html) from Jeffree's 2007 song ""We Want Cunt"" feature the n-word, among other problematic and insensitive lyrics.

&#x200B;

\-In 2009 on Warped Tour, Jeffree ""roasted"" his fans and told one that they ""look like they have autism."" He also threatened to kill an entire group of people. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ni9_AweQY)

&#x200B;

\-In 2009 Jeffree [called a fan of his ""fat.""](https://www.instagram.com/daavaaad/p/BIE4QWnD5ci/)

&#x200B;

\-[This](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4l67gr) is a fan made video that was created to highlight Jeffree’s hypocrisy. Here are some examples from the video: In 2012 while performing, a fan grabbed Jeffree's crotch. He retaliated by grabbing her hair, berated her in front of the audience, and having her kicked out. On the other hand, footage from 2009 shows Jeffree grabbing the crotch of another man (Steven Spence, internet personality/drummer?) who appears uncomfortable and immediately recoils. Next the video addresses how when Rocky Roadkill made a video about his broken Skin Frost, Jeffree said he should've reached out to customer service. He also accused Rocky of being desperate for attention and pathetic. However, when Jeffree bought Kylie Cosmetics lip glosses and found the wands to be messed up, he immediately took to SnapChat to complain and drag Kylie, rather than contacting customer service.

&#x200B;

\-In [this 2010 interview](https://www.redrivernoise.com/uncategorized/2010/05/qa-interview-jeffree-star/index.html) there are a few relevant quotes. Jeffree admits to tasing a guy who poured water on him. When drawn comparisons between Jeffree and singer Pink because of their hair, Jeffree says that he doesn't look like her because he ""doesn't look like a fucking dirty lesbian."" Later in the interview he says ""I  don’t hang out with gay people really. Most gay guys are like women, they’re fucking annoying. There is so much drama and cattiness. I stick with the “bros.” Lastly, he says ""I’m all about business, usually, but of course I like to go out and have fun. The other night I punched a girl and threw drinks everywhere. That’s just what happens if people are going to talk shit.""  Jeffree clearly has no problem inciting violence against women.

&#x200B;

\-In 2016, Kat Von D called out Jeffree for not paying the artist who created his logo, whom KVD introduced Jeffree to. He avoided KVD when confronted about it, and only paid and made reparations once she publicly outed him.  [Screenshots](https://thebeautyboysite.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/13720686_327669154246799_1919287446_o.jpg?w=768) ; [KVD's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzu5NzgxNwg&t=3s)

&#x200B;

\-For years prior to 2016, Jeffree was best friends with Kat Von D, who is an alleged antisemite.

&#x200B;

\-In 2016, Jeffree tweeted drummer Tai Wright telling him to kill himself. [Article with screenshots](https://thisisnotyourscene.wordpress.com/2016/07/21/jeffree-star-tells-ex-slaves-drummer-to-commit-suicide/)

&#x200B;

\-In 2017, Jeffree called Kat Von D a ""dumb whore"" on Shane Dawson's podcast. [Revelist article](https://www.revelist.com/beauty-news-/jeffree-star-kat-podcast/8349/this-podcast-was-recorded-in-early-june-so-star-said-these-things-weeks-before-his-vow-to-quit-being-an-online-aggressor/6)

&#x200B;

\-Also in 2017, Jeffree's Androgyny palette campaign drew criticism. The campaign photos of Nikita Dragun show that her skin was clearly darkened for the sake of the advertisement. [Photo proof](https://www.seventeen.com/beauty/news/a45491/jeffree-star-blackface-controvercy/)

&#x200B;

In 2018, Jeffree manipulated drama channel TeaSpill into canceling a potential series about Jaclyn Hill by implying that Jaclyn was close to suicide over it. When this was brought to Jaclyn's attention, her response implies either that she did not give Jeffree permission to share that sensitive information about her mental health; or that it was untrue. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/b6e41e/hftt_receipts_say_j_influenced_teaspill_into/) is a thread on that situation.

&#x200B;

\-In 2018, he also [parked in a handicapped spot](https://images.app.goo.gl/1RkEcCQ3th9jMSBE6) at Jack in the Box in Malibu.

&#x200B;

\-In January 2019, Jeffree went off on YouTuber and fan Porcelain/Bridgette when she politely advised against trying Bhad Bhabie/Danielle Bregoli's makeup brand. He went on to post a positive review of the brand the next day, which many people believe was not genuine and/or was paid for, which is a direct contradiction of his ""I'm so rich, I keep it real,"" narrative. [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/akfm63/j_tweets_about_bhad_bhabies_makeup/) is a more in-depth thread on the situation.

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

&#x200B;

\-In June 2017 a girl @cjcbeauty found what she believed to be a human hair in her JSC Skin Frost Highlighter. She tweeted Jeffree, and he sent back a nasty response before blocking her. His tweets have since been deleted, but [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/ZHHr8zGnQWvFx1vZA) is one screenshot. Also [here](https://www.allure.com/story/girl-claims-she-found-a-hair-in-jeffree-star-highlighter) is a write up about this by Allure.

&#x200B;

\-In Jeffree's June 2017 favorites video, he praised the Jaclyn Hill x Morphe palette and said ""a few shady YouTubers swatched them and tried to say they weren't pigmented. Y'all are shady fucking c\*\*\*s and you tried to do Jaclyn dirty and you're wrong for that.""  It's speculated that he was talking about Sam Ravndah and Beauty Birdl, who had a negative review of the palette. [June 2017 Favorites Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebOqNwr9sl0) he makes the comment @ 4:19. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66zj-f7oUC4) is a Karina Kaboom video about it.

&#x200B;

\-Called Queen of Blending a cesspool for saying something negative about his Onyx Skin Frost. [Screenshot](https://images.app.goo.gl/ME9vWe72Xa6NBMRG6)

&#x200B;

\-Jeffree's Mystery Boxes (Black Friday and Valentine's Day) were coming with dried up lipsticks and content that didn't match the description. Jeffree responded to the criticism with this tweet ""there are peeople who don't have clean water to drink in this world...there are people who have no home because they were just burned down...You people have real problems if you are concerned about a mystery box,which was clearly stated what was inside, a MYSTERY."" He quickly deleted the tweet, never responded to customers, and blocked anyone who tweeted him about it. A Twitter account titled @jeffreestarmboxes put out [this statement](https://twitter.com/JeffreeStarMBox) summing up the issues.

&#x200B;

Edit 3, 5/19/19

&#x200B;

\-This [tweet](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6ewWc-WkAIwFV_.jpg:large) from 2010 resurfaced in May 2019. In the tweet Jeffree, 24, is talking inappropriately about Justin Bieber, 16. Shortly after this tweet resurfaced, Jeffree deleted over 1000 tweets. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JHxsVrN63Q&feature=youtu.be) at 6:55, Jeffree addresses the deleted tweets and just says ""if people tried to drag up the same thing every 6 months, you'd delete it too.""

&#x200B;

\-Amidst the drama between Tati Westbrook and James Charles on May 12, Jeffree [tweeted](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/james-charles-jefree-star-1557758763.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*) at James's brother Ian: ""Why is your brother a predator?? Why'd you really move back to NYC? Exactly. Shut the fuck up."" Not only is Jeffree is directly accusing James of being a predator with zero proof, but he's also publicly bullying a 17-year-old kid who is completely innocent in the entire situation.

&#x200B;

\-Jeffree continued to [tweet](https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/640/640/80/2019/05/13/10/ey/ea/ph4jpwe00g2qbwe.png) ""There is a reason that Nathan banned James Charles from ever coming to our home again. There's a reason why I haven't seen him since @GlamLifeGuru's birthday in February. He is a danger to society. Everything Tati said is 100% true."" Jeffree is accusing James of being a danger to society, again with no proof. Also, Jeffree seems to be lying about his feelings about James considering he [tweeted him](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6aPQY2WwAEJ_FQ.jpg:large) since Tati's birthday (February 14) and seemed to be cordial.

&#x200B;

\-On May 18, 2019, James Charles uploaded a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFvtCUzfyL4) titled ""No More Lies."" In this video, James explains his side of the drama with Tati Westbrook. He also addresses Jeffree's tweet about him and to his brother Ian and reveals texts that Jeffree sent to him and to his friend Drew. Please read these texts [here](https://imgur.com/a/axFZ26F). In these messages, Jeffree accuses James of VERY serious things; molestation, false imprisonment, pedophilia, sexual harassment, etc. In James's video, there is proof that his relationships with all of the men mentioned were consensual. Jeffree is not only making false accusations in private over text but also threatening James to make these false accusations public \[and doing so by calling James a ""predator"" on Twitter as mentioned in the previous bullet point.\]

\-In a resurfaced retweet from 2012, Jeffree mocks people with disabilities. Someone tweeted to him “fighting online is like competing in the Special Olympics. Even if you win, you’re still retarded,” to which he quote tweeted and added “HA -> RT."" [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/chtnu6/jeffree_stars_tweet_has_surfaced_the_internet/) is a thread about the tweet which includes a screenshot.

\-In 2014 Jeffree posted [this photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/w2_GSoTUeq/)  to instagram, which features him wearing a jacket that has the nazi eagle on it. When called out in the comments, Jeffree replied “they \[nazis\] stole it, just like the swastika used to be for Buddha...Don’t spread ignorant comments without stating the facts.”"
7,How do I get my burden of a sister (20) out of my mother's house?,4060,i6iqxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/i6iqxr/how_do_i_get_my_burden_of_a_sister_20_out_of_my/,108,1596977173.0,"My 20 year old younger sister really proved that she is a disappointment. She refuses to get a job or go back to school. She lays in the house all day doing absolutely nothing except sleep, eat and stay on her phone. She expects our mother to clean up after her. When our mom asks her to do the simplest chore, she goes into screaming and yelling. Cursing out our mom, locking herself in our mom's room, calling her friends and making herself into the victim. 
   
Recently both my mother and I were cleaning the apartment. My sister was layed up in our mother's bed with the AC on full blast just chilling on her phone. When my mom asked her to clean the bathroom she goes ""why don't you tell OP to clean it"". When I let her know that she needs to get off her ass and respect her mother, she goes off on me, slams the door shut then calls her friends to cry about how much we bully her. She'll leave piles of dirty dishes in the sink and will refuse to wash them until they attract roaches. She leaves/throws food wrappings behind beds, the TV on the floor, everywhere. She is the reason why we have rats and roaches. When she's putting on makeup she'll rub the excess mascara from her eyes onto the bathroom walls and all over the sink. She has a pile of filthy, wet, smelly clothes just sitting on the  bathroom floor that she refuses to take care of. She stays up in the middle of the night having the loudest most ignorant conversations which consist of laughing and cursing. When we ask her to quite down she screams to who ever is on the phone ""OMG ARE YOU HEARING THIS?!?! I TOLD YOU THEY HATE ME, I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO Y'ALL WITHOUT THEM HATING ON ME... I KNOW RIGHT THEY'RE SO TOXIC!!!"". She is extremely belligerent. She thinks that screaming the loudest and talking the fastest means you've won an argument. She even make fun of our mother's accent. We are Nigerian and English is my mother's second language and she has a thick accent. The fool will actually make fun of the way our mom pronounces things, going as far as to make fun of our mother for being a home health aid.
   
 I am at my limit. This has been going on for years. She has physically fought our mother and I numerous times. Wished death on both of us, reduced our mother to tears and so much more. The police have done nothing. They say that we have to go through the courts if we what her removed from the apartment. Mind you she has never paid a bill and still except our mother to pay her cell phone bills. She runs the AC in my moms room on full blast all day, the current electric  bill is $140. Due to Covid everything is at a stand still. The family courts encourage people not to come into the offices, and to just call, but no ever picks up those calls.
    
I really need some advice. My mom cries everyday because my sister is a nightmare. We've already tried consulting, she just says the usual ""my family hates me"" thing. The best solution is that she is removed from our mom's apartment. We live in NYC. Does anyone have any legal advice on how to remove her?




EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the advice. I'm taking time to read through them with my mom. I'll update when we've found the best solution. PLEASE CONTINUE TO SEND ADVICE. ALL IS NEEDED AND APPRECIATED.

If you’re on r/NFL a lot, you’ve probably noticed that whenever there’s a story about a player working in charity or something, I comment that if they were a dog, they’d be a good boy. I thought I should write something up like the [Which teams have fewer fans than their namesake? A study](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6jarda/ocwhich_teams_have_fewer_fans_than_their_namesake/) that we got last year in the offseason. 

The way I am going to tell who the most good boy is by picking one player each team and giving them a good boy rating. Right now you’re probably asking, “oh, but u/CharleyJacksson, how did you decide what player represented each team?” Well, I basically just picked fan favorite players that have a good reputation for working in charity, or just didn’t rape someone or murder a guy. 

I recommend donating to your favorite good boy’s charity of choice :)

#Denver Broncos Good boy: Von Miller

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://www.vonmiller.org/)

Starting out with my Raiders most hated rivals, the Broncos most good boy is Von Miller, a 6-time Pro-Bowl OLB. The biggest knock to his good boy-ness came in 2013, when he was suspended for violating the league's rules on drugs. He apologised and has done a lot to help restore his character. Von is a big supporter of our troops, and has a foundation to help kids get glasses.

#Kansas City Chiefs Good boy: Eric Berry

Good boy rating: 11/10

[Charity link](http://eb29.com/online/eric-berry-foundation/)

If this were a test to see what player would be the toughest boy, Eric Berry would win. After playing 5 seasons in the NFL, Eric Berry was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but was back on the football field a year later. Berry has suffered several injuries throughout his playing career, including a torn ACL in 2011, a high ankle sprain in 2014, and a ruptured Achilles this past season. As a Raiders fan, I find it very hard to root against him. He is exceedingly inspirational, and an overall great person. Eric runs The Eric Berry Foundation, which provides beneficial opportunities and a safe environment for children to participate in team sports and leadership development programs in order to encourage strength of body, mind and spirit. Eric also travels with mobile medical clinics, even going to Ugandan villages in 2013 and 2014. 

#Los Angeles Chargers Good boy: Philip Rivers

Good boy rating: 9/10

[Charity link](http://riversofhope.org/donate/)

Rivers is known for being a fantastic leader and great trash talker. A 7 year boy fighting two different types of cancer in LA wanted nothing other than to meet Philip, so Philip got in a car, drove two hours each way just to meet him, and watched a Ravens-Chargers game with him. Rivers said, ""there was a kid that could be dying any day, and he wants to meet me of all people. This 7-year-old could make any wish and he wants to hang out with me. Man, you don't turn that one down."" Philip’s charity is Rivers of Hope, a free 24 hour crisis line. 

#Oakland Raiders Good boy: Derek Carr

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://www.valleychildrens.org/)

Now for my favorite Good boy. This one was tough because I had to come up with a fair and unbiased rating for him. Derek is a fantastic man that is not shy to stand up for what he believes in. He is very involved in his faith, and works closely with Valley Children’s to help sick children. After signing his $125mil contract, the biggest contract in NFL history at the time, Derek was very excited to talk about all the positive ways he will spend his money, saying, “The exciting thing for me money-wise, honestly, is this money is going to help a lot of people. I’m very thankful to have it, that it’s in our hands because it’s going to help people. Not only in this country, but in a lot of countries around the world. That’s what’s exciting to me.”

#Houston Texans Good boy: JJ Watt

Good boy rating: 37,000,000/10

[Charity link](http://jjwfoundation.org/)

Everyone knew this one was coming. The Walter Payton Man of the Year winner this season, JJ Watt made headlines after raising $37,000,000 for Hurricane Harvey relief. He not only raised that substantial amount, but he also did as much as he could by going out and giving the men and women of Houston food and water. Although it took a detour to help after a disaster hit home, JJ’s foundation, “mission is to provide after-school opportunities for middle-school aged children in the community to become involved in athletics, so that they may learn the character traits of accountability, teamwork, leadership, work ethic, and perseverance, while in a safe and supervised environment with their peers.”

#Indianapolis Colts Good boy: Darius Butler

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](http://dariusbutler.com/foundation/)

This player is probably one one of lesser known good boys, but it is not undeserved. Darius’ foundation strives to help feed the hungry and inspire kids in rough communities. His father served 11 years in the Army, so Darius knew the importance of life and the cruel, uncaring void that we call a universe. 

#Sacksonville Jaguars Good boy: Blake Bortles

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://www.blakebortlesfoundation.com/)

Blake Bortles is anything but trash. A mid-tier starter on the field, Blake gets a lot of hate thrown his way. He has become a fan favorite after upsetting several teams who called him and his team garbage. Off the field, he is a fan favorite for his goofy, [awkward interview with Barstool](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7qtapx/qb_blake_bortles_on_what_he_would_be_doing_if_he/), and his fantastic charity which supports first responders in the Jacksonville area, and helps people with intellectual and developmental disabilites persue full and indepent lives.

#Tennessee Titans Good boy: Delanie Walker

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://delaniewalker.org/)

Everything I hear about Delanie is positive. He has broken out the past 4 years, getting over 800 yards 4 seasons in a row as Marcus Mariota’s go-to receiver, and he has taken advantage of his success on the field and used to to spread awareness and help those less fortunate than himself. [You may remember him offering to let bullying victim Keaton Jones come to a Titans game.](https://247sports.com/nfl/tennessee-titans/Bolt/Delanie-Walker-brings-awareness-to-school-bullying-112048402) His foundation stands to provide inner city and low-income children with educational opportunites and resources to reach their full potential. 

#Baltimore Ravens Good boy: Joe Flacco

Good boy rating: 6/10

[Charity link](http://www.the-red-devils.org/)

Joe Flacco is elite in the hearts of Ravens fans everywhere. He has fully embraced Maryland and the Baltimore area, spending a lot of time working for the community. While he doesn’t have his own foundation, Joe has worked with several other charities, most notably The Red Devils of Maryland, a breast cancer foundation. He has also worked with several of other Raven’s players foundations, including Ray Rice, Ben Grubbs, Derrick Mason, and Ed Reed. 

#Cincinnati Bengals Good boy: Andy Dalton

Good boy rating: 8/10

[Charity link](https://www.andydalton.org)

Andy is a fellow Texan and ginger, so I will always support him and his fire crotch. Andy’s foundation became famous after he put the Bills in the playoffs and fans donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to it. The foundation, run by his wife, does several things for Cincinnati and Texan communities, including bring technology, educational resources, and entertainment devices to schools and hospitals, a daycare for parents of sick kids so they can go and have a date night, a all-expense-paid trip to a theme park for sick kids, a fund for medical equipment that goes to the families of sick children, and trips to children hospitals from Santa and his Elves. 

#Cleveland Browns Good boy: Joe Thomas

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://www.sc4k.org/)

Joe Thomas is known for being a dedicated player, sticking with a franchise that shoots itself in the foot repeatedly. He is a fan favorite for being a super cool dude. He doesn’t have his own foundation, but is a huge advocate of Shoes and Clothes for Kids, which gives shoes and clothes to kids. One thing is for sure, Joe Thomas isn’t as terrible as his franchise is.

#Pittsburgh Steelers Good boy: Alejandro Villanueva

Good boy rating: 11/10

[Charity](https://secure.uso.org/?sc=WEBDONATE&show_amount=true)


Alejandro, a former Army Ranger, is a massive supporter of the military. After bring national attention to himself after accidentally standing away from his team, his jersey sales spiked, and he donated all of the money he got from them to the USO and other military non-profits. 

#Buffalo Bills Good boy: Andy Dalton

[Charity link](https://www.andydalton.org)

Andy is a fellow Texan and ginger, so I will always support him and his fire crotch.

#Miami Dolphins Good boy: Kenny Stills

Good boy rating: 4/10

[Charity link](https://pledgeit.org/kennystills)

I honestly had no idea to pick for the Dolphins. Jarvis Landry, Ryan Tannehill, and Cameron Wake don’t seem to have favorite charities, and Jay Cutler’s foundation is shut down, or at least doesn’t have a website or anything. Most of the charity work I found under Jay Cutler is from years ago. Kenny was their Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee and is active in the stand against social injustice. 

#New England Patriots Good boy: Nate Solder 

Good boy rating: 6.9/10

[Charity link](http://special.patriots.com/offers/index.cfm?UUID=NEPCFDonations)

Nate protected Jimmy G’s beautiful face for a couple games. He also did some charity work or something with kids or something, but he protected Jimmy G’s face. 

But in all seriousness, Nate is a great guy. He works with the Patriots foundation to help build playground for kids.

#New York Jets Good boy: Quincy Enunwa

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://palnyc2008.thankyou4caring.org/pages/donate)

A lot of people may have forgotten about Quincy, but I haven’t. He’s a great slot receiver, a real gym rat. He won United Way of NYC’s Hometown Hero award, and works with NYC PAL to help kids play sports.

#Dallas Cowboys Good boy: Jason Witten

Good boy rating: 11/10

[Charity link](http://jasonwitten82.com/foundation/)

Jason is a stand up dude on and off the field. I always thought he ran real weird though. That doesn’t matter though, he’s a cool dude. His foundation helps with NFL Play 60, and helps put positive influences in battered women’s shelters all over Texas. I implore you to go to his charity link and read about all the things his foundation does. It’s fantastic and I’m not surprised because Jason is just so great. 

#New York Giants Good boy: Eli Manning 

Good Bote rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://www.hackensackumcfoundation.org/site/TR?team_id=2016&fr_id=1430&pg=team)

Eli is a massive dork and is totally self aware of that. He’s such a great guy too. He is responsible for the Pats losing 2 SBs, and works closely with several charities and organizations. The one I linked to is one for children with cancer, and him and his wife will match all donations to it. Eli is a really good boy.

#Philidelphia Eagles Good boy: Carson Wentz

Good boy rating: 17/10

[Charity link](http://www.ao1foundation.org/)

Carson was so close to locking up the MVP trophy before he tore his ACL. After reading about his foundation, I had to up his Good boy rating. One of his foundations 3 objectives is to support the development of individuals by providing service dogs to help increase their quality of life. I got a service dog several years ago and he saved my life. I am so happy to hear Carson is trying to help more people get service dogs.

#Washington Redskins Good boy: Kirk Cousins

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://theelaineshusterfoundation.org/)

Kirk loves Julie very much. He is knowns for complementing players for hitting him and apologizing to his O-Line after sacks for holding onto the ball for to long. Whoever lands him in free agency is very lucky to get him and Julie. He and the Redskins donated several dollars to The Elaine Shuster Foundation, which brings money to education in Maryland. 

#Chicago Bears Good boy: Sam Acho

Good boy rating: 13/10

[Charity link](http://www.livinghopeministries.us/donate/)

As a massive Longhorns fan, I’ve always loved Acho. He is well known for his trips to Nigeria to help those less fortunate. He, and his brother, are fantastic and what he does for people cannot be understated. 

#Detroit Lions Good boy: Matthew Stafford

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://leadersandbest.umich.edu/find/#!/mimed/mott?utm_source=givetomott&utm_campaign=givebtn)

Stafford is seriously underrated and I like him a lot. Everything I just read on him said that he does a lot of charity work but it isn’t publicized very often. I found a cool story where he won an auction for Lions tickets, parting with $15,000, then gave the tickets to a sick child. What a good boy.

#Green Bay Packers Good boy: Aaron Rodgers

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity](https://give.salvationarmyusa.org/site/SPageNavigator/national_memorial_form.html)

Aaron Rodgers is possibly the most talented QB to ever play the game of football. He’s also the star of some state farm commercials that has a very good boy in it. He doesn’t good work off the field too, he donated $38k to Salvation Army. 

#Minnesota Vikings Good boy: Teddy Bridgewater

His purpose will not be denied. 

#Atlanta Falcons Good boy: Julio Jones

[Charity link](https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/donate/)

Julio would be a very good boy. He would be very good at catch. He, along with his Falcon teammates visit Children Miracle Network Hospitals to cheer sick kids up. He is also a big fan of Campbell’s Soup. 

#Carolina Panthers Good boy: Cam Newton

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://www.cam1newton.com/)

Cam is known for his confidence on and off the field, so I think he would be a hard boy to settle down and train, but I bet he would be a good boy once he is trained. He works at his foundation to enhance the lives of youth by addressing their educational, physical, and social needs. 

#New Orleans Saints Good boy: Drew Brees

Good boy rating: 14/10

[Charity link](http://www.drewbrees.com/)


I lived in the NOLA area when Hurricane Katrina hit, and what Drew has done for the people of that area is immaculate. He does his best to make the community better and inspire every person he meets. He would be a very awesome boy.

#Tampa Bay Buccaners Good boy: Gearld McCoy

Gerald grew up hungry and lost his mom at only 19 to an unexpected Brain Aneurysm. He had a rough road to get here, but that doesn’t matter, Brian, he’s here. He spends time with kids at free football clinics, teaching them how to be great men like himself.  

#Arizona Cardinals Good boy: Larry Fitzgerald

The winner of Defensive of Player of the Year in 2017, Donald is the best DT around. Wade Phillips even said he should have won MVP. A couple years back, Donald won a Madden charity tournament, giving $51k to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. 

#San Francisco 49ers Good boy: Jimmy Garoppolo

#Seattle Seahawks Good boy: Russell WIlson

Good boy rating: 16/10
[Charity link](https://whynotyoufdn.org/)

Russell is the definition of a class act. He has donated millions on top of millions to various charities and hosts golf tournaments. He even gave the Patriots a Superbowl. He is a favorite of mine and if it wasn’t for Carson Wentz being such a dog lover, and JJ Watt saving a city, he would be the most good boy in the league.

12,"You're a Destiny fan and you're curious if you should get this game... Yes, you 100% should!",1724,7oyt0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/7oyt0c/youre_a_destiny_fan_and_youre_curious_if_you/,375,1515421389.0,"So here you are. You’re either curious about buying this game for the first time, or you played it at launch, stopped for whatever reason, and are thinking about playing it again. You like playing Destiny, but are sick of the BS as of late, and wish it was more in depth. You keep hearing great things about The Division, and you're curious. Should you start playing? Where do you start? What kind of endgame is there? Is this game even *fun*?

Yes. Yes, you should play. This is a fantastic game now. Who am I? Nobody important, just a fan, but I’m here to tell you that The Division is for you.

Let’s start with some statements and key differences, in no particular order.

**This game got terrible reviews, and some of my friends bought it and hated it. Why play it now?**

 - This is true. This game was hyped up (similar to Destiny 2) to be the “Destiny 1 Killer”, and some felt that it fell flat. There were glitches, bugs, hackers and the endgame was subpar. The playerbase died and the developers couldn’t fix it as fast as some liked. Eventually the devs came out and flat out said their game was broken and they were delaying the DLC so they could fix the core game... and they did around update 1.4. Then later around update 1.6 they also said that their PVE was too bullet spongey, and they changed things so it felt like you were fighting an enemy instead of a health bar. Now with update 1.8, this is like The Taken King compared to vanilla Destiny. The game is fresh, rewarding, but most importantly, *just plain fun*.

**I don’t like 3rd person shooters. I’m more of an FPS kind of person.**

- I thought the same thing. I used to be a Call of Duty/Halo/Destiny player only. And I was never a fan of 3rd person in games like Assassin Creed and such, they just felt wonky and weird. The 3rd person and movement system works *fantastically* in The Division. Cover to cover, running, using abilities. It just works. It feels good. Like using a super or using a sword in Destiny, how it feels good? That’s how The Division is. 

- The movement and UI system is top notch, and honestly might have the best UI of any game I’ve played on the PS4. The guns also somehow feel incredibly unique, but good, for being a 3rd person shooter. A Vector SMG plays different than an MP5 SMG, a Lightweight M4 is different than a Warlord AR, etc. The guns feel like they have individual personalities. It’s surprising how good the game plays in 3rd person.

**It doesn’t make sense to empty 100 rounds into a street looking thug in NYC. That’s weird.**

- That’s true, it’s weird at first... but with that logic it doesn’t make sense in almost any video game, especially aliens wielding special abilities in Destiny. Have an open mind. It wouldn’t be fun if you killed everything in 1 bullet. Enemies have varying levels of armor. Think of it as them having lots of armor (just like you do). And with the way Massive reworked the health bars/movements of enemies, it feels more like you’re playing against an enemy versus a health bar (a problem that plagued The Division *and* Destiny early on). 

**I miss customizing my build from Destiny 1. I miss the “Space Magic.” I hate being forced to play builds I don’t like in their team-shoot meta.**

- In Destiny 2, you put on Better Devils, MIDA or Uriel’s Gift, and that’s it, that’s the best… In The Division, you can play any way you want, and nothing is “better” than anything else. Everything can be set up to be fantastic. The different playstyles are vastly different and can even be different in the same style. There’s a number of different guns, perks, abilities, talents, and mods to set each up. There’s even armor sets, and if you have a full 4 or 6 piece set it will unlock more perks/abilities. If you want to be the world’s strongest sniper, you can do that. If you want to be a tank with a riot shield that draws aggro from your team while doing damage, you can do that. If you want to sit back and snipe things and heal your team, yes, you can do that. You can set your gear up where you face tank enemies with a shotgun and you’re almost impossible to kill. There's a build where you can shoot your LMG for what seems like forever. There’s even builds where you can have the strongest abilities that make things blow up and go *BOOM!* There’s builds where you can light things on fire with a turret. There’s builds where you can do a little bit of everything. There’s builds so you can speed run PVE activities, or be strong as hell in PVP. There’s a build for everything, and everything is surprisingly fun, and all of it can be customized *exactly* how you like. It’s insane.

**Doesn’t New York City get boring? It’s a city in the winter. How interesting can it be?**

- You would think so. You would expect repeating buildings and textures and such... But the developers went into such detail to craft each area different, to make everything feel unique. The sky boxes are incredible. Each skyscraper looks different. They hired graffiti artists to make art for the game, to make the city feel alive. They crafted each area to feel special. Even different *alleyways* feel unique. You can shoot out individual windows in cars, like, individual panes of glass. You can shoot out individual tiles in the walls down in the subway. There’s dogs that walk around that sometimes poop. Random rats run around. There’s different levels of snow, sometimes to the point of a full-on blizzard. The snow will even settle on objects and even your character’s shoulders, and when the snow eventually goes away your clothes will look wet. Hell, if you’re on PC and you look close enough, *there’s individual snowflakes*. 

- The amount of detail this game goes into is amazing, and the accuracy to the real world is astonishing. I visited NYC at Christmas time a couple years ago, and every time I’m running through the Dark Zone going from “Midtown Music” to “The Pit”, I’m just reminded of the time I saw the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall (Midtown Music), and then we walked over to the ice skating rink by Rockefeller Center (The Pit) and saw the giant Christmas tree. There’s dozens of posts on this subreddit showing pictures of the real world and the in-game world, and it almost matches perfectly…The city truly feels alive. If you don’t believe me, go watch a YouTube video or go on Twitch right now and see for yourself.

**Doesn’t it get boring fighting the same masked bad guys over and over?**

- Did it get boring fighting the Fallen and Hive in Destiny? I mean, aren’t they all aliens? Of course, but there’s differences between the aliens, just like there’s differences between the 4 different enemy factions. They even have differences in between them depending on place to place. You have rushers, snipers, tanks, Tacticians, healers, straight shooters, flamethrowers. All enemies have their own quirks, weakpoints, and movement styles. Bosses have a little more character. It’s actually quite impressive the amount of variation and personalities the developers gave enemies in The Division, for them “just being humans”. Besides, there's a certain level of satisfaction that you will get no matter how many times you make a Cleaners' fire tank blow up or make a Heavy Tank's explosive backpack explode.

- Above all that, there’s Hunters... Hunters are probably the toughest PVE enemies I have ever played in a video game. My heart *pounds* when they spawn in. It feels like you’re playing a skilled player. Seriously. They’re terrifying. I'm not going to spoil them for you with details because the first time you face one is a real treat, but their movement style and use of abilities is probably the closest I have ever seen an AI enemy feel like a real person. It's incredible and gets your blood pumping. Hell, there was a post on here the other day asking how a PVP player killed them in a Survival PVE mode, and people were like ""Yeah, you just faced your first Hunter"". The enemy style is fantastic in The Division and I would love to see Hunters added to other areas of the game, and excited where they can go with them in the future. 
	

**The game has been out for a long time. How am I supposed to gear up and be competitive?**

- The game throws loot at you for everything. Seriously. Reach level 30, and play whatever it is that’s your favorite thing to do, and work on reaching “World Tier 5” (as you get better gear after Lv. 30, your gear score will increase; the higher the gear score, the higher world tier you can go in, and then that means the better loot you get, WT5 being the best). Weekly missions, Underground, Dark Zone… whatever. And loot will rain from the heavens. Certain things give better rewards than others, but a good chunk of everything will drop *from* anything. Play with friends, or meet someone online, or use the in-game matchmaking to play things, and people will even share items they don’t need with you. I played with my one friend just last night. He reached Lv. 30 about 2 hours before I got online – after doing a couple different activities and sharing our stuff, he had 3 exotics, a number of great high end guns, and a few different pieces of gear sets including a full striker set, and could now do endgame activities with us. 

**Did you say in-game matchmaking? Is that like Guided Games? Oh no…**

- Yes I did. And you can’t even compare those two. Guided Games in Destiny is the biggest steaming pile of garbage I have ever seen for in-game matchmaking. Wait in orbit for an unspecified amount of time, unable to do anything else, and then no one else can join after the activity starts, and there’s no checkpoints… It’s so bad that I wonder how the developers at Bungie *actually* published that, and stand by it like it’s a good thing. I wonder how anyone can wait *45 minutes doing nothing* to do a raid, only to have it not completed. A literal waste of time. It’s terrible. 

- The Division has seamless matchmaking, for everything. From your little daily missions to Resistance to Legendaries or Incursions, there’s matchmaking. And if you don’t find a group right away, load up the matchmaking and do *anything* else you want. The game will continue to search for a group for you, and when one becomes available a little icon will pop up for you to join the group. Something that The Division does great is 95% of the content is hard enough where it’s challenging and difficult (and rewarding feeling), but it’s not downright mechanic heavy and impossible like some of the stuff in Destiny raids. If everyone doesn’t have the absolute best gear, you can still do the activities, it just might take a little bit longer (think of Destiny year 1 Nightfalls, minus getting booted to orbit). I wish sometimes that The Division had a *little* bit more mechanics in things, but because it’s not as mechanic heavy, you can do most Legendaries/Incursions with any PUG group. 

- There’s also in-game chat and proximity chat. In Destiny, you can’t talk to people next to you in the Tower, not even in your clan, for being such a social game. It's baffling, honestly, and a huge reason a lot of PC players quit Destiny 2, and I mean, seriously, *what kind of social PC game doesn't have a freakin' in-game chat?!* And if you do want the option to meet new people like a traditional LFG, there’s a few Division LFG websites, some Facebook Division groups, a Division LFG subreddit, but the best thing of all (in my opinion) is the Discord, which can be found on the sidebar or [clicking right here.](https://discordapp.com/invite/thedivision) If you like them, add them. Pretty soon your friends list will be overflowing with great and friendly people who want to play.

**What else does The Division have, that Destiny does not?**

- Horde mode! Oh, you know how people have been *begging* Bungie for a horde mode of sorts? Since there was basically one of those back to the Halo days, and Call of Duty’s Zombies mode is super popular, and it would seemingly work great in Destiny. Yeah, The Division has that. 3 different maps to play with increasingly stronger waves of enemies. And it’s rewarding, giving you reward caches and also the option throughout the mission to open a reward chest to get even more loot (high level and rare loot which you can use). 

- Randomly generated dungeons! Wait, WHAT?  Yes. You know that thing Bungie just released called the Infinite Forest that everyone thought would be like rifts from Diablo? But it turns out that it’s actually not infinite at all, you can just run through it and you get *nothing* for doing it (also, it’s boring other than looking pretty the first time you do it). In The Division it’s called the Underground. You go in, and you can put on different modifiers (oh how Destiny is missing that) on different levels of difficulty while also choosing 1-phase or 2-phase or 3-phase (varying lengths of time), depending on what you want to do. The bosses in there drop loot, and there’s a chest at the end, and there’s sometimes random chests scattered throughout. You’ll almost never see the same area twice as the possibilities of areas generated are endless. It’s a fantastically fun game mode that is a blast to play.

- Dark Zone. It’s PvEvP. If you don’t know what this is, it’s a special area that has “landmarks” and bosses in there that respawn after a set amount of time. It also has other players. Rare loot can drop in here, but when you pick things up you have to call in a helicopter to “extract” the loot out, since it’s contaminated. All players are friendly to each other, until someone possibly “goes rogue”. Other players can and will kill you to steal your loot. Others will play nice and invite you or join your group and form an alliance with you. It’s a great mode that really makes you watch your back. Now, this experience may not be for everyone, but I’m a fan of it. The suspense of getting a fantastic exotic to drop, and having your heart pound as you hide behind a wall as the extraction helicopter comes in, and you’re hoping no one surprises and kills you… it’s an experience that I haven’t felt in any other game. The Dark Zone is a massive area and there’s always something to do. 

- Survival, either PvE or PvEvP. This is basically like a battle royale mode similar to Fortnite or PUBG. You get thrown in and start with nothing, and have to find better loot as you go. You can do just PvE if you’re that kind of person, or do the PvEvP if you want a fun challenge. You can help other players or kill other players. The loot you possibly get at the end is decent, but you’re not doing it for the loot. The experience of Survival is amazing. There are some players that all they do is play Survival. It’s a seriously fun game mode that is just *fun*. I know, right, fun in a video game?? Incredible. 

- Loadout feature: This one is such a great quality of life feature, I can't believe it's not built into the game in Destiny. Set up your guns and armor with all the mods you like, down to the abilities and talents you have, and then you save it. Bam, it's now saved forever. You can currently save up to 5, and now with the click of a button you can change your entire Loadout and playstyle. Oh, your team needs a healer? Switch to the Reclaimer/sniper loadout you made! Headed to the Dark Zone? Put on your Nomad with your great SMG! Tired of Nomad? Put on your Lonestar Classified build for your crazy stream of LMG bullets from your Big Alejandro. This feature is seriously *amazing* and I feel is not appreciated enough.

**How much is this game going to cost me? I don’t have another $60-$100 to spend like Destiny charges.**

- This game is $10 used at Gamestop. I’ve seen copies sell even cheaper than that on eBay. New, it’s under $30 at most big stores. I’m sure there’s other places that sell it cheap too. The base game, no DLC, comes with the whole game, two Incursions, Dark Zone, Resistance, and the new PVP mode. You only need the DLC (or the season pass) if you want to play Survival, Underground and Last Stand. **You do not need the DLC to progress in the game.** I know this is a weird concept coming from Destiny, where you *have* to have to the latest DLC in order to play the game, but all the DLC in The Division is *extra* and doesn’t take anything away from the core game. And if you do want to buy the DLC, there are sales all the time. The Season Pass (all 3 DLCs) was just on sale on Microsoft/Playstation store for $16, and the Gold Edition (game + DLCs) was on sale for $29. I think it was even cheaper on PC. I’m not sure if the sale is active right now, but check it out.

- If you just want to check this game out, buy it for $10. Even just the base game for $10 and all the activities at endgame will easily give you 100+ hours of playtime if you get hooked. The amount of stuff to do for only $10 is astonishing. For the price of what is literally 1000 silver in Destiny 2 (might buy you a couple shaders with that, such *bullshit*), can get you this fantastic game. 

**Edit: As of writing this post (thanks u/LastGuardianStanding for the heads up!) the game is on the PSN digitally for $14.99. The Gold Edition (including all the DLC) is $29. I believe it is the same price/slightly cheaper on the Ubisoft store (I don't play on PC, I am unsure of exact pricing, sorry). It is $9.99 for a used copy of the game at GameStop (no DLC). (Sorry Xbox users, no sale!) Again, you don't need the DLC to enjoy almost everything this game has to offer, but I think the Underground and Survival are fantastic and alone worth the price of the DLC. $29 for the Gold edition is an amazing price!**

I love this game and have been absolutely hooked since the free update 1.8 came out. The game feels so fresh and alive, just like how Destiny felt after Age of Triumph was released. The player populations for this game are higher than they’ve ever been, Twitch viewership numbers are up and even beating Destiny 2’s at certain times. But most importantly of all, it’s just *fun*. The game is fun. I feel so stupid for saying this, but it’s just a fun freaking game, and I feel like that’s a hard thing to say these days when we have games that are such a disappointment.

**TL;DR: The Division is a fantastic game and incredibly fun, and the best time to start playing is now!**"
13,"20 years ago, in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, Michael Myers stepped into a car and drove from Langdon, Illinois to a fictional northern California town. He covered 1,994 miles, averaged 63.2 MPH, refueled nine times, and was stymied by a flat tire",1651,94rujn,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/94rujn/20_years_ago_in_halloween_h20_20_years_later/,141,1533475689.0,"I put this piece on Reddit last year, but I had to bring it back to celebrate the 20th anniversary of *Halloween H20: Twenty Years later.* This cross country trip is a thing of beauty and I feel the world needs to know more about it. 

The only thing that can stop an unstoppable force is a red traffic light. For over 40 years Michael Myers and his driving skills have been scrutinized and mocked. How did a “shape” who lived in a mental institution learn how to operate a vehicle? Michael’s driving in the first film has never bothered me because the driving was erratic and primal. The driving that bothers me is in *Halloween H20: 20 Year Later* because he made a 1,994 mile trip successfully with zero citations or tickets. In the film Michael drives from Langdon, Illinois to Hillcrest Academy in Northern California in a daring feat that raises a lot of questions.

1. Does he wear the mask when driving or siphoning gas?
2. Did he listen to the radio?
3. How does he deal with merging onto highways? Is he cool about it?
4. Does he dislike people who drive slow in the fast lane?
5. Does he not know how to fix a flat fire?

I remember loving the film as an impressionable 15-year old punk. The movie had thrills, Dawsons Creek-esque dialogue and Jamie Lee Curtis going on the offensive. However, I’ve never liked that a mysterious shape could drive cross-country. Michael Myers works best as a mysterious murderer who doesn’t have parent issues and could care less about following traffic rules. He had to navigate a lot of terrain on his journey which means he had to follow the rules and not murder people who cut him off.  The trip took him an estimated 45.5 hours (thank you for the time change assist Reddit). Here is the timeline (with some guesswork and actual times from the movie):

**October 29 – 5:30PM** – Leaves Langdon in a stolen 1971 Buick Skylark.  A  handy grandfather clock states that it is 5:30PM.

**October 31 – 9:00AM** – Michael steals a 1956 International Harvester Travelall  at a rest stop off Highway 139 in Northern California.

**October 31 – 10:00AM**– Arrives in the fictional town and cruises around a bit before he settles on main street at 11:00AM

**October 31 – 1:00PM** – Follows Laurie from the downtown area and finds out where the school is.

**Total time:** 45.5 hours

Breakdown of hours

32 (driving Highway/Susanville) + 6.5 (refueling) + 2 (waiting on main street) + 2.5 (waiting at rest stop) + 1 (eating? He eats rats in Resurrection…dude needs snacks) + 1.5 (nap?) = 45.5

Michael left Langdon on October 29th at 5:30PM in a 1971 Buick Skylark and drove all the way to California. He was forced to stop close to his destination when an unfortunate flat tire forced him to stop at a rest stop along Highway 139. During the trip he had to make at least nine pit stops to refuel because the 71 Skylark only averaged 15 miles per gallon and the 15.2 gallon gas tank only got him a maximum of 228 miles. I think it might be easier for him to refuel at night but according to the math he had to make five daytime gas stops. That had to get kinda complicated because he had no money, doesn’t talk and didn’t steal any steal cars. 

To make it in 29 hours like the Google map states he would have to drive 68 MPH. I don’t buy it so I slowed him down to 63.2 MPH. 63.2 X 32 hours on the road = 2.022.4. He covered 1,994 miles on the various highways and 28.4 on Highway 139 and various other roads after he found the school.

Since Langdon and Hillcrest are fictional, I found cities that are relatively close to the locations. Langdon was in Livingston County, Illinois so I found a town that had a similar population. Then, I looked along Highway 139 in Northern California and picked Susanville due to its proximity to the highway and Yosemite State Park (because there is a convenient school trip there). The locations aren’t exact but I was working with fictional towns so I to make an educated guess.

After coming up with the distance and car information I started thinking about Myers using his blinker while making turns or switching lanes. There is nothing less frightening than thinking about him casually flipping on the blinker to make a left turn. After looking at the directions Michael had to use his blinker AT LEAST 17 times (per google maps) if he always stayed in the slow lane. If you add the nine pit stops to exit the highway and his cruising around the small town that is somewhere around 40. Thus, Michael Myers the unstoppable killing force had to use his blinker 57 times. Immortal demons with pitch black eyes should never be bothered with speed limits, rear view mirrors and potential zipper merges.

There you have it! Michael Myers successfully completed a long drive and never got pulled over.

**Random Fact:** Movies featuring Michael Myers driving long distances (100+ miles) [make more money] (https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=halloween.htm) (counting inflation) and have higher Rotten Tomatoes averages than the movies that don't feature him driving.

"
14,My (19F) Dad (40s M) has an obsession with buying exotic or illegal animal meat and is why my family fell apart.,1130,ehvj9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ehvj9t/my_19f_dad_40s_m_has_an_obsession_with_buying/,390,1577755178.0,"So my dad has always been a kind of strange guy but I never really noticed. I was used to it and that's just who he is. He isn't mean but doesn't talk much, very busy with work, doesn't seem to be interested in anyone's life, that kind of thing. When I was a kid gradually our relatives stopped visiting. My dad wasn't in contact with his family, but my mom's used to be around alot. Then they stopped. I remember hearing my mom fighting with her parents a couple times. I gathered they didn't like my dad. I haven't seen my cousins in years. We used to be close as kids. I was never one for social media, but recently reactivated my facebook and decided to look up some of my relatives on a whim.

I messaged my cousin I was closest to, 18F, also my aunt (her mom) 40's F) My cousin didn't seem to know why we hadn't seen each other but my aunt said I should ask my mom. It ""wasn't the sort of thing I should hear from her (my aunt)"".

Mind you I'd asked my mom before a few times, she always said they were too busy to visit... I was really confused and we ended up having a long conversation yesterday. I had to insist on a real answer. Now I am horrified at what I found out. Her family is freaked out by my dad because a few years ago when they came for dinner (this was a bunch of people not just my aunt and cousin) they found out what he'd said was beef was actually kangaroo meat. My mom had specifically gone out of her way to make the meal herself because she KNEW my dad had done this BEFORE, so she banned him from cooking but he secretly swapped the meats during some point she wasn't in the kitchen! She admitted to her family he was constantly doing this to us. Yeah now I know I've eaten a ton of gross shit he'd said was beef or chicken. And whenever I didn't like something it's probably because it wasn't what he said.

She told me that he's been obsessed with trying exotic meats for years. Now looking back I remember times I saw weird unlabelled meat packages in the basement freezer, I just never thought to inspect it. She said he has spent thousands and thousands of dollars in getting them. They are rare and cost a lot, plus travel costs, and paying off his contacts who pass information about where he can find whatever he's looking for. It's driven my parents to the verge of financial ruin multiple times. My mom also said they've nearly divorced a few times. I used to hear them fighting sometimes as a kid, now I guess I know why.

You're probably thinking he just has adventurous tastes and this can't be that bad, so I'll give the full picture of everything she told me.

Some of the things he's had are weird to standard Americans but I realize might not be that weird other places (the kangaroo, and horse for example, wolf, camel, shark fin soup.) Some is ""questionable"" I guess, such as something called ortolan bunting (look it up) and seafood eaten while still alive. Then some of it is straight up illegal. Like she said he once killed and ate a bald eagle (he hunts normal game which I knew but also protected species.) He's obtained bushmeat, meat from African wildlife that's illegally imported here, this includes stuff like rats, various monkeys, chimpanzee, apes and gorillas, pangolin, porcupine, civets, and giraffe. From what my mom knows he bought these from some markets in NYC that sold it in immigrant communities. 

It became even worse with other 'exotic' animals. He has gone so far as to travel to other countries specifically to hunt/get meat from particular animals. These have included, zebra, cheetah, elephant, hippo, Bengal tiger, endangered rhino, in places in Southeast Asia and Africa. He went somewhere in the Caribbean to hunt and eat dolphin. Brazil for anaconda. My mom says that a trip he's going on next month to China, is specifically to try to find a way of eating Chinese salamander and Panda meat. These are both very endangered species! It's seriously illegal there to kill pandas, that's not something chinese people actually eat but he's determined to do it. 

And he's been like that about some of the other ones I mentioned that are also rare or under protected status like some types of gorillas and orangutans. Who hears of an endangered animal and thinks, ""aha, I want to eat that.""? Wtf? Oh and he also wants to go to the antarctic to hunt penguin and whatever else is there before the ice melts (He's already been to the arctic and eaten stuff there apparently).

My mom has to snoop on his laptop to keep an eye on what he's doing since he stopped talking about it. He knows she doesn't approve but she can't do anything. They just pretend it's not happening, and she reads his emails with contacts whenever he mentions needing to go on a trip ""for work"". She says it sounds like these people are involved in foreign animal trade networks. He's very secretive. She has to deliberately wait for a minute he's in the bathroom with computer logged in.

She has been terrified for years that any day he's going to get arrested. They (my mom and younger siblings) rely on my dad's salary, my mom is disabled with a chronic illness and cannot work, so would only have disability checks to get by on. 

There's more she didn't even tell me because it ""wasn't appropriate"" and refused when I said I could handle it. So I can only imagine what else he's done.

I don't know what to do. My family is on the brink of falling apart and I never knew. I will never look at my dad the same again, this is really disgusting to me. My mom can't divorce him because they rely on him. She won't talk to her family about it because they just tell her to divorce. I know she's very anxious but I feel like I've almost lost respect for her because she knew the whole time and never at least warned me. I'm also pretty sure she has lied to me saying we never had a cat when I was little, except I remember it and don't remember what happened to it, which now I'm sick thinking maybe my dad did something. My mom insisted I was thinking of someone else's cat but there is a photo of me as a little girl with that cat on my bed. 

I'm in college on the other side of the country and only home for a few more days. My mom made me promise to never say a word to my dad, ""he'd kill me."" This is all so fucked up to me. I'm really worried about them and what they'll do if he's caught. Also wtf is wrong with him??

What can I do? Should I confront him, or try to convince my mom to leave? Get her family involved? It's like disarming a bomb, I don't want to do anything that would just blow everything up but I cannot imagine him just getting to continue doing whatever he wants....

TL;DR: My dad has secretly been pursuing chances to eat meat from exotic/endangered animal species whenever he can. He's totally out of control to the point of breaking the law to get it. Throughout my childhood he snuck it into food he made us pretending it was something normal like beef, pork or chicken. My mom is too scared to leave him or do anything. Has anyone ever heard of something like this? What are my options?"

17,Multiverse of Madness,942,cxwok1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/cxwok1/multiverse_of_madness/,75,1567264557.0,"So we all know that there was 14,000,605 outcomes of the endgame against Thanos. However it is important to note that a sorcerer cannot see past their own death, so this begs the question... are there maybe trillions of endings where Doctor Strange died in the endgame and the Avengers still somehow won? It happens to be pretty plausible actually, as there are infinite parallel universes meaning there should be an alternate reality where the rat still released Ant-Man, but Strange died. I think that Wanda will discover a reality where Vision lived and Doctor Strange died but the Avengers still beat Thanos. She’ll blame Visions death on the Master of the Mystic Arts, and go insane which will bridge the realities and cause a rift which will leak into the Prime timeline (MCU). The movie will be based on horrific alternate universes that bridge into the Prime timeline. Not sure how that will go. Simply a theory. Now, as for the post-credit scene... I personally believe it will be set in NYC and that the Baxter building will appear out of nowhere due to the rift. And it’ll end with Reed Richards walking out the front door and he’ll have the white stripes in his hair and he’ll just say “where the hell am I?” Or something edgy like that. This is just a possibility tho, it would be a cool way to introduce the F4 while debunking the theories that “The One Ending” was NOT the only way. It’ll prove that Doctor Strange was right and that the only way life would continue normally would be that One.

Edit: what if Multiverse of Madness introduces the Nightmare Infinity Stone. I think Wanda’s powers and the way she might bend reality in the film, will ultimately lead her to somehow creating or literally BEING the Nightmare Stone. Just a thought tho.

Edit 2: scrap that last edit, I think that Wanda will become an Antihero in her tv series leading her to make a devastating choice in MoM. It could be catastrophic, to the point where she divides realities into one giant reality like in the comics.

Edit 3: Nightmare, the rumored villain in the film, will most likely cause Wanda to believe that a reality like this existed- giving her reason to cause problems, thus bringing Dr Strange in. I can also see Hawkeye making some sort of appearance as he was always able to soothe Wanda."
18,"Mom lies to law enforcement, gets 2/3rds of her kids jailed.",939,8yyzzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8yyzzg/mom_lies_to_law_enforcement_gets_23rds_of_her/,62,1531626614.0,"So one day, when i was 17, my mom tried to make me wake up at 8am on a Saturday to go look at houses my brother might buy. I said he would make the decision to buy or not buy the house regardless of my presence, and that I was not going. Being a smart ass teenager who was cranky about waking up early on a weekend, I told her to shut the door on her way out of my room. She attacked me, dragged me out of bed by my hair and began strangling me. I felt like I was legit maybe going to die and, for the first time ever, hit her. But she ate it. Becoming increasingly desperate I started hitting her over and over again, she didn’t flinch. Part of me wondered if I was only imagining I was hitting her. It was a crazy few moments. My brother eventually hears a commotion and gets her off of me. Later on that night we all ordered Chinese food and had an awkward laugh about it when suddenly both of my moms eyeballs turned black. 

Turns out I hit her harder than she was letting on. She had some contusions on her forehead that were draining blood into her eyes. She looked like a demon. She had a broken nose, the contusions, black eyes, got some stitches, claims to have permanent vision impairment... it sounds like I really did some damage but I’m telling you she didn’t flinch or let up her grip on my neck until my brother got there.

So she kicked me out. Three weeks later truancy police show up to find out why I haven’t gone to school. She tells them i beat her up and ran away. A warrant is issued. I eventually turn myself in. I was initially being charged with an A misdemeanor and was looking at a year in jail. I copped a plea and ended up with a b misdemeanor, sentence to the 90 day max, and served 60 of them.... in Rikers, which apparently was the largest penal colony in the world at the time, according to Wikipedia. 

To say I did not belong there is an understatement. First of all, most of the people there are mentally challenged. It’s a damn shame. Everyone credits Mayor Giuliani with cleaning up NYC in the 90s, but really what he did was make it illegal to be homeless or mentally challenged. All the “undesirables” got swept under the rug and thrown in jail. Arcane laws and a disorganized system mean they can languish there indefinitely. The Rockefeller laws of the 70s made it so that small drug offenses lead to big sentences. So, for political reasons, Rikers Island is full of crazy people, mentally challenged people, and drug addicts. Very few people there are just straight up conniving criminals. But that’s a different discussion for a different sub. 

The relevant part is that my mom told the judge that I was both suicidal and homicidal. So when I first got there, as protocol, I had to be placed in a 72 hour suicide watch which was the most depressing place I’ve ever been in my life. I bonded with a 16 year old prostitute who was there after testing positive for HIV. I was given a Bible by a woman who sold her daughters virginity to a crack dealer.  After the suicide watch ward, i was automatically and according to protocol, transferred to the Mental Observation ward. Where everyone was insane. My only friend was a paranoid schizophrenic who thought devil worshippers broke into her apartment at night. She would collect any strands of hair that fell off me and give them back to me because she was afraid someone would to voodoo magic against me if they got my hair.  I saw a woman get her shit kicked in because she didn’t give another woman her cookies. Like this woman beat her ass down like a gorilla beating up a small child. The gorilla asked me for cookies first, it could have been me who got that beating, but i guess she sensed the other woman was the weakest link in the group. It was a brutal place. 

Every single time a psychiatrist or social worker came in I would talk to them and insist I didn’t belong there. Even some smug group of NYU students who came to observe and learn like we were lab rats. One of those  students would have dated me under different circumstances, and there they were , studying me and looking down on me. After a few weeks they were convinced and I was transferred to the youth ward. 

Anyway, I’ve completely turned my life around since that low point and it’s all good. Its not even on my record because i was a minor. But when I got out my first question to my mom was why the fuck did you tell them i was homicidal ??? They put me in the mental ward with criminally insane people ! “I did it for your protection!!” She swore. “I didn’t want you in general pop.!”  I believe this is a lie. 

Do you know what They do in general pop.? They play spades, watch Jerry springer, and trade pop tarts for cigarettes. It’s chill as fuck. 

BUT WAIT. My mom wasn’t done trying to ruin her children’s lives with lies. 

So fast forward a decade or so, and now my brother (yes the one who was house shopping), is not in a great place. He admitted to his wife he had multiple affairs and got kicked out. So he was staying at my moms house. My mom is berating him one morning about what a loser he is, he ruined his life, she’s not going to pick up the pieces, etc. etc. 

My brother got upset and put a hole in one of her walls, got in his car and drove away. She called the cops and said that he attacked her. 

She also told the cops that he is homicidal and suicidal  !! Sound familiar ? So between that, and the fact that he’s in a weird place with his wife, now there’s like an all out manhunt for my brother. My mom lead the cops to believe he might hurt his kids (he would never), so they’re looking everywhere for him. My other brother convinced him he should go talk to the cops to calm down the situation so they stop thinking he’s a potential murderer on the loose. He agrees. 

So, this brother is a veteran. He served overseas, came home and had a job as a federal agent for 8.5 years. Had he held out another 6 months, he would have been able to keep his gun. Alas, he had to turn it in. But he had another handgun, I guess illegally. He kept it in a safe in his garage. 

When he goes and talks to the cops they ask him if he has any firearms. He figures he’s an upstanding citizen, no prior, he’s a veteran and had a law enforcement job for quite a while, he’ll be fine, and in the sake of honesty he tells them “yeah, I keep a handgun in the safe of my garage.” Booom. Felony gun charges. They held him in the precinct for a few days before my mom posted his bail. He could have seen the judge and gotten bailed out earlier, but due to protocol they had to place him in a 72 hour suicide watch. My mom cried about her poor baby and how scared and miserable he must be. 

So now my brother, a veteran and former law enforcement agent with a clean record, who was never homicidal or suicidal, is in an ongoing court case for a felony gun charge all because my mom told an all too familiar  lie to law enforcement. Yes, the gun was illegal, but he’s not a drug dealer or anything and the thing never left his safe because he never had a reason for it to. 

In true fashion for her, my mom is paying top dollar for his lawyer. And she bought him a new car. She lied, got him in this mess, and is spending a fortune on his legal fees that he is incurring because she lied. 

My other brother lives halfway across the country and is a serious mamas boy and has never done anything that upset my mother, or else I’m sure she would find a reason to call the cops on him and tell them he’s a suicidal killer as well. "

Hey Everyone! Happy Anniversary! Follow Lightning's Journey to GitGud. Looking for resources to improve herself at 7*

Here is a very special comic celebrating what makes FFBE such a great game--Our Community! Who cares about patches, bugs or gimu when we have our mega awesome community to celebrate!



I wanted to personally thank these contributors who work tirelessly without compensation besides our appreciation. Here are the ones featured in this comic:

>**Cysidus** helps maintain the Exvius Wiki. Cysidus actually reached out to me about hosting LM comics archive in the art sections and good luck Chow. ~~I never finished the archive pg! Ish sorry!!~~

>**DefiantHermit** once took on the mantle of should you pull after the original creator srs_bsns left. Not only wise, this hermit had a defining sense of humor that went into each banner review. DefiantHermit's should you pull was long and full of effort! These days, the wise sage watches over us as a mod. 

>**Nazta.**

>**Memel0rd** is probably my go to source for reviews modern day. It's a lot of hard work but he doesn't take any shortcuts and calculates out all the math. He's also looking out for the Brave-Exvius Forums. We collaborated on the dark and light forum headers using his idea.

>**Lyrgard** created the ever popular FFBE Equips tool. I know I have spent several hours toying with JP Lightning builds. Sometimes I spend more time on the builder than on the real game. We collaborated on the header art but Lyrgard came up with the idea for each page himself.

>**-Sio-** has an ever impressive library for Macro users. Long long long long ago, I tried to use an emulator just to try one of his Macros. Unfortunately my craputer could not handle it. Nevertheless, many rat slayers can thank -Sio- for their powers.

>*jk i have more for Nazta, who does basically everything. Here are some tidbits you may not know! The anniversary banner looks great right? Nazta made a convincing request to the JP artist for permission after my request was rejected. Nazta also created the FFBE April Fools subreddit style. The sub header now requires 2 sizes which Nazgod is also on top of.*







There's so many helpful members of our community and way more than I featured in this comic. I hope you'll forgive me if I didn't get to you! A big thanks goes out to them!

Last but not least, thank you everyone who support L&M! I wouldn't keep making comics if it wasn't for your warm welcome. I read every comment that's posted. I'm always tempted to reply to every one of them (But that would just spam the post!)

While we can't make the left understand facts, we can at least call them out with the resources we have.  Since social media is restricting conservative news and views to help democrats win the #2020 election and worse twitter/facebook/google/youtube are just hiding articles for #2020. 

We know the Left controlled states AG departments are promoting their hate agenda towards the conservatives and whites, as they are targetting people who defend themselves and conflate it with terrorism. (See #Proudboys in NYC and self-defense criminal case in Washington State.) 

So what can we do? Where do we stand? Why is the Right not united behind Truth?  Is Trump our only salvation against the leftist agenda?  Is there more going on behind the scenes than we know to defend American Values?

Thoughts?"

I want to pass forward a few items that seem to be lacking, I was traveling for 5 weeks and upon my return there were and are a number of things that are going to be addressed by the Board:   
**You have until Saturday, June 29, 2019  11AM**  


**Patios:** Read your Documents and House Rules move to get those things that are allow and NOT allowed OFF THE PATIOS: the patios are a limited common area NOT a STORAGE area, if on Saturday anything is on your patio you will be fined; some owner as directed, informed the Board of ongoing issues- or have prior approval for items that are on the patio, but it seems to be some misunderstanding on the Patio items, but that will end. NO excuses, NO warnings- FINED and you can see the Hearing Board.   


**Dumping/Garbage:** if your dumpster is FULL walk to another dumpster- leaving your garbage ON THE GROUND and piling it up like a NYC GHETTO is unacceptable and will be met with a $500. Fine! Illegal dumping is different within the Documents as you can clearly read, if the HOA is charged for the Waste Management people to clean up the area, on TOP of the fine, your unit will be assessed the other outside cost as well, such as the Landscaper cleaning up the debris and as most owners here KNOW WE LIVE NEXT TO A GREENBELT/Apartment  with rats/mice/raccoons/rabbits- WHY WOULD A PERSON or PERSONS leave their garbage on the ground to be FOOD for those and other animals is beyond ME and others! But if it takes, FINES at an extreme level then, that's what will happen.  


**Parking:** if I inspect the parking lot and see any vehicle in our visitor parking without proper stickers- YOU WILL BE TOWED! If you or your renters PARK in another's owners CLEARLY marked parking stall you will be towed and that offender (if a renter or NON OWNER) will be removed from parking on the HOA property- get your Documents out and Read them the HOA absolutely has the power to remove and rescind any privileges that are afforded to an OWNER! This behavior will cease or the average cost for a tow is $450. And daily storage cost on top of that is $85 a day- DO NOT PARK IN SOMEONES stall, without their written permission! And renter better start moving their car(s) every 24HRS! Or they will be towed NO QUESTIONS ASKED!-  we have renters here with 3-4 cars! That is coming to an end, harshly to the owners who clearly are not monitoring their Renters! It is not the BOARDS responsibility to address your renters, they are NOT OWNERS- and as owners you better grasp this or we will fine you, take your rental funds until the fines are paid off in full- if you don't think that can and WILL happen you should read the Washington State Statues (RCW's) on ""rental intercept"" -- Time to get things back in order!   


**Speeding:** Any renter(s) seen AGAIN speeding around this property will be REMOVED! Again, if you are an owner and you are doing so WHY? OUR INSURANCE IS at stake!  We have small children/elderly/and pet owner walking around the property and I have witnessed the speeding- and one renter the same renter got a very direct message! OUR insurance cost for the property is HIGH ENOUGH! Tell your renters to cease their behavior or they will be parking elsewhere! The Board /Owners control the common areas, such as the driving areas to your assign stalls! If you think I will not enforce this to cease the reckless/dangerous/deadly  behavior you are very WRONG! If you are a NEW owner, get your documents OUT and read them because I hold you to them, as we are held as Board members.   


If you disagree with the above, I am not worried, nor concerned.... what I am addressing are the areas that are blatantly being abused to the detriment of all owners and their VALUES to their investment!  


**Come Saturday morning 11AM- unless you have been given prior approval to items on your patio, you will be fined/if you are the ones who are PILING garbage on/around the dumpsters ground/ and your renters are Parking/Speeding/And has more vehicles than registered with the Board on the property- sooner, I assure you rather than later you will be seeing the Hearing Board...and those vehicles will be towed.**"
28,The 7 people you'll meet at your interviews,569,fanxjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/fanxjc/the_7_people_youll_meet_at_your_interviews/,100,1582858577.0,"Now that interview season is just about over, I figured it would be a good time to step back and reflect on the 7 people who were at all of my interviews.

&#x200B;

1. The Speed Talker- This is the asian girl from a California state school who speaks at 200 words/min. Dark hair and a black pant suit. She's super nice, but you can tell she is cutthroat. I was standing behind a speed talker in the lunch line once, I asked her where she's from and by the time she finished answering lunch was over. Their parents are immigrants, their dream school is Stanford, and they have been dating the same guy since 2012 . She answers questions during the Q&A session and hand wrote a thank you letter ahead of time to hand deliver it to the Dean.
2. Mr. Ambiguous- He's the ethnically ambiguous brown guy who is super down to earth. He comes in two versions: very tall and very short, but both versions are skinny. He has a great smile, and holds a conversation well with most people. Originally from California, but went to college on the east coast. This guy's suit doesn't exactly fit him, but you look past that because he seems like a genuinely good dude. He has the highest MCAT score in the room, but would never mention it. 
3. Mr. Obscure- He's the ethnically ambiguous brown guy who is not super down to earth. He makes small talk about his pet rat and his ailing grandmother. He's Lebanese. Or Cuban. Maybe Puerto Rican. You don't know and you don't ask him. He has too much gel in his hair and you're scared to shake his hand. He is from a different state at each interview, sometimes Texas, sometimes Wyoming. He uses an android. 
4. The Dan Smith- Mormon? This guy could not get more average. He likes to hike, plays basketball, and is learning how to cook in his gap year. He is dressed like a businessman and got a compliment on his tie from the Dean. You sat down with him at the beginning of the day. His fiance is applying to her biochem PhD programs and he's praying they end up together. His parents are both doctors, and he's curious what there is to do outdoors in the area. Fluent in Spanish and passionate about helping minorities.
5. The one who isn't on Reddit- This is a guy who, upon talking with him, you learn has no idea how the application process works. He was a business major for 3.5 years before deciding to go premed in his last semester. He asks you questions like ""What's that school with no tuition again?"" and ""Does Harvard take walk-ins for interviews?"". He seems particularly confident that he'll get into the school you're interviewing at, but he won't. In fact, you're pretty sure he hasn't even taken the MCAT yet. He fell asleep during the financial aid talk and took a call in the middle of an interview.
6. The Non-Trad- This guy has seen some stuff. He's a Marine, but he won't talk about it. He has a 5 year old from his first marriage, and his new wife is expecting. After working 7 years in the tech industry, and the last two years as an EMT, he decided to move into medicine just because he could. You can see his tattoo sleeve peeking out of his suit arm, and he's the only one in the room with a full beard. You're scared of this guy because he refers to the other interviewees as ""kids"".
7. Mrs. Universe- She has the best english in the room, despite it being her third language. Born in Nigeria, she lived in NYC for most of her life and has 4 older siblings, all doctors. Her undergrad was in Washington D.C. where she worked for the United Nations. She has been to all 7 continents on service trips and wants to be an OB/GYN. She personally knows the head of diversity."

#**For the Dirt Poor**

**The dollar slice.** The classic cheap eats of NYC. You'll find business men, students, to crust punks  all snackin' on slices. [Here's a map of some one dollar joints](https://slice.seriouseats.com/2010/03/where-to-get-99-cent-slices-2-bros-dollar-pizza-in-nyc-with-map.html). After trying a bunch you will find your favourite spot. Your opinion is correct unless it's the 2 bros on St. Marks.

**Dollar dumplings.** Not really a dollar anymore (1.50 - 2 as of 2019) They're a bunch of places in Chinatown that offer low cost dumplings. A really common snack for after school kids and drunk adults.  Like the dollar slice, after ratting around you'll eventually find your own spot and fall in love.

#Grocery tips

Eating out is great and can be done cheaply. But if you really want to save guap, you should be cooking.
Here are some tips on how/where to shop smart and cheap.


- Fruit stands

Apparently not a huge thing outside of NYC? I had no idea. Transplants don't be distressed! They're totally normal, safe and used by the rich and the poor. If you didn't already know, most fruit vendors (stores and carts) get their fruits from the same source. Here's a few [articles](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/nyregion/the-secret-life-of-the-banana.html) that answer the question, ""WHERE DOES THE [FRUIT](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/nyregion/15fruit.html) COME FROM??""

If you have enough friends or just LOVE fruit you can head cut out the middle man completely.  When I was a little girl -- my father would bring me to the fruit warehouse and buy direct from the wholesale source. It's a great way to save serious cash. But holy shit it was a lot of fruit.

- Rotisserie chickens

NYC's standard rotisserie chicken price is five bucks. Max is seven bucks.

You can buy them at your local grocery store, Costco, or even Whole Foods. (Though I've heard the later is a bit bland.)

- Chinatown Vendors

You really wanna stretch you dollar? Buy from the street vendors in Chinatown. If you go at the end of the day, they're basically giving you shit for free. It's imo the best place to buy veggies, fruits, and fish.


- Your local bodega 

Become a regular at your local bodega and be polite/kind. Often times the guys make up random prices because they know me. It's great paying a buck fifty for a gallon of milk.


- Shop smart

If you're really hoping to shop on the cheap, you've got to put in effort. Often times grocery shopping is an all morning affair for me. Take a Saturday read your local circular and walk around to grab the best deals. Those dollars you save add up.


- Try bulk buying 

Every couple of months, my friends pile in a car and head to Costco. If you have the means, it's a great way to save a lot of cash. 

- Try Aldi
The fabulous German brothers have broken into the NYC grocery pool. They're two locations in NYC. The commute could be worth it! I go to Aldi  about once every 2/3 months. I do the BIG shop and grab essentials. It's crazy how cheap it is. If you go -- do bring bags because they charge for them.

##Week of Jan 20 - 26: What We Learned in the Trump and Russia Probes

&nbsp;

#MUELLER INVESTIGATION

#Mueller: Trump

**Banker meeting.** A banker with ties to Russia [attempted](https://abcnews.go.com/beta-story-container/Politics/us-banker-ties-putins-circle-sought-access-trump/story?id=60521702) to get a position in the Trump administration, using producer Mark Burnett as a connection. The banker, Robert Foresman, lived in Moscow for years and led a $3 billion Russian investment fund. He allegedly has connections to Putin’s inner circle. Just nine days after Trump was elected president, Burnet emailed Tom Barrack, chair of Trump’s inaugural fund, to get a meeting for Foresman. While the meeting was ultimately canceled, it would have occurred between a Barrack’s meeting with Kushner and a meeting with Trump. In January, Foresman obtained a meeting with Michael Flynn. 

* In December 2016, Foresman met with the chairman of a state-owned Russian development bank, Sergei Gorkov in New York. Later that month, Gorkov flew again from Moscow to New York to meet with Kushner.
* In January 2018 Sen. Dianne Feinstein sent a [letter](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/f/1/f19163da-6008-42d4-b366-c9b6e7cfb227/223D610282FCE44DA71BC9E431E6AED2.2018.01.25-df-to-robert-foresman-re-interview-and-document-request-redacted.pdf) to Foresman stating that the Judiciary Committee “has reason to believe that you sought to engage the Trump campaign in discussions concerning outreach from senior Kremlin officials.” The senator requested documents and testimony (it is unclear if Foresman ever appeared in person). Additionally, in October 2017 Sen. Dianne Feinstein [requested](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/8/a/8a93c676-cc97-4c84-8b19-d508b079ee13/32CC56D7DBEC4F0BFBEC437EC28AD937.cambridge-analytica-letter.pdf) records of communications from Cambridge Analytica with a variety of people, one of whom was Robert Foresman.
* The Trump campaign official Foresman attempted to meet with, Tom Barrack, was a [long time](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/10/31/what-did-thomas-barrack-know-and-when-did-he-know-it/) friend of Trump. Barrack also knew Paul Manafort for years and reportedly got Manafort hired as Trump’s then-convention manager. After Manafort was fired, Barrack was instrumental in keeping Manafort’s business partner Rick Gates on the transition team and, eventually, the presidential team. According to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/upstairs-at-home-with-the-tv-on-trump-fumes-over-russia-indictments/2017/10/30/fd0d0b16-bd87-11e7-8444-a0d4f04b89eb_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_no-name%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar&tid=a_breakingnews&utm_term=.9638bb4c7169), “some White House advisors are unhappy with” Barrack for keeping Gates “in the Trump orbit.” Mueller [interviewed](https://www.apnews.com/6dd33b4234634079821e5825f112e85b) Barrack in early 2018. Sources said the questions focused on Manafort and Gates, with a few about the inaugural committee which Barrack chaired.

&nbsp;

**Giuliani’s interview #1.** Last Sunday, Trump’s attorney [Rudy Giuliani said](http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1901/20/sotu.01.html) Trump had conversations about the Trump Tower Moscow deal “throughout 2016,” and could have continued “until the election.” Giuliani also stated that it’s possible Trump talked to Michael Cohen about his congressional testimony (during which he lied) before he appeared before Congress. When pressed, Guiliani said it “would be perfectly normal” and “so what?” He further added “as far as [he] knows” there were “no discussions with [Cohen] in which [Trump] told him or counseled him to lie.""

&nbsp;

**Giuliani’s interview #2.** The next day, Monday, Giuliani gave [another interview](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/even-if-he-did-do-it-it-wouldnt-be-a-crime-rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-robert-mueller-moscow-buzzfeed) to The New Yorker. After being asked how he knew the Buzzfeed story about Trump directing Cohen to lie was fake, Giuliani said he knew it was false because he has “been through all the tapes.” When questioned about the tapes, he backtracked: “I shouldn’t have said tapes… [There were] No tapes. Well, I have listened to tapes, but none of them concern this.”

* Then, In a rambling stream of consciousness, Giuliani admitted he is “afraid” his gravestone will read: “Rudy Giuliani: he lied for Trump.” He continued, “Somehow, I don’t think that will be it. But, if it is, so what do I care? I’ll be dead. I figure I can explain it to St. Peter.” 

&nbsp;

#Mueller: Stone & Corsi

**Stone arrested.** Friday morning, Roger Stone [was arrested](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/longtime-trump-adviser-roger-stone-indicted-by-special-counsel-in-russia-investigation/2019/01/25/93a4d8fa-2093-11e9-8e21-59a09ff1e2a1_story.html?utm_term=.92c9d83c96b1) by (unpaid) FBI agents at his Florida home after being indicted by Mueller’s grand jury. The indictment is comprised of seven-counts, including one count of obstruction, one of witness-tampering, and five counts of making false statements for lying to Congress about his communications with Wikileaks and the Trump campaign. He [faces](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/chrisgeidner/roger-stone-indictment-mueller) up to 20 years in prison on the tampering count and up to five years in prison for each of the other charges. Stone was released on $250,000 bail; outside the courthouse he proclaimed he is innocent and said he “will not testify against the president.” Agents [were seen](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/us/politics/roger-stone-trump-mueller.html) removing hard drives and other evidence from Stone’s NYC apartment and raided his recording studio.

* The indictment lays out that between June and July of 2016, Stone told “senior Trump campaign officials” about the stolen emails in WikiLeaks’ possession that could be damaging to Clinton. Then, after Wikileaks released the hacked DNC emails on July 22, “a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign. Stone thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Organization 1.” Organization 1 is Wikileaks and the senior official is [believed to be](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/steve-bannon-is-high-ranking-trump-official-mentioned-in-roger-stone-indictment.html) Steve Bannon, leaving the biggest question to be answered: Who directed Bannon? 
* It was known by June 2016 that Russia had hacked the DNC. Yet the response of Trump's campaign was to search out more illegally obtained damaging information on Clinton. [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stones-indictment-reveals-team-trumps-profound-betrayal-of-their-country/2019/01/25/d38a72de-20c7-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_term=.69658b58ae2b): Days after Mr. Bannon was directed to contact Mr. Stone, on July 27, 2016, Mr. Trump publicly called on Russia to find and release Hillary Clinton’s “missing” emails. We now know the Russian hackers attempted to break into Ms. Clinton’s server the same day. On Aug. 2, according to the indictment, Mr. Stone was advised by one of the WikiLeaks intermediaries that the campaign should start suggesting that Ms. Clinton was unwell, because that would be a “focus” of the “next dump.” Mr. Trump gave a speech on Aug. 15 charging that Ms. Clinton “lacks the mental and physical stamina” to fight the Islamic State.
* The witness tampering charges come from Stone [threatening](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-stone-factbox-idUSKCN1PJ1FS?utm_source=reddit.com) Randy Credico to stick to his cover story: Stone wanted Credico to claim to be his intermediary to Wikileaks. When Credico refused, Stone threatened him, going so far as to say he would “take” his therapy dog away. In one email, Stone said: “You are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds.”
* In the documentary ""Get Me Roger Stone,"" Paul Manafort [said](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/manafort-on-trump-roger-stone) during an interview: “Roger’s relationship with Trump has been so interconnected that it’s hard to define what’s Roger and what’s Donald.” There are many scenes of Manafort and Stone conferring, working to get Trump elected. 

&nbsp;

**Arrest responses.** The following are notable responses to Stone’s arrest.

* Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1088832908494888961) after Stone's arrest: “Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION! Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better.” The president also suggested someone may have tipped off CNN to record Stone’s arrest, though there were growing signs the day before that Stone could be charged soon.""
* Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, [said](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/chrisgeidner/roger-stone-indictment-mueller), ""The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else. Rather, the indictment focuses on alleged false statements Mr. Stone made to Congress.""
* [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/12519-4/): “The indictment of Roger Stone makes clear that there was a deliberate, coordinated attempt by top Trump campaign officials to influence the 2016 election and subvert the will of the American people… the President’s continued actions to undermine the Special Counsel investigation raise the questions: what does Putin have on the President, politically, personally or financially?
* Layers for Jerome Corsi, who is mentioned in the indictment for speaking to Stone about Wikileaks, [said](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jerome-corsi-my-interactions-with-roger-stone-listed-in-mueller-indictment-are-accurate): “...it would appear that the Special Counsel's investigation has been thorough and complete and the Stone indictment is accurate with regard to references to Dr. Corsi, consistent with Dr. Corsi’s testimony and interviews... and confirms that Dr. Corsi has not been and is not being accused of any illegality.”

&nbsp;

**Grand jury testimony.** Andrew Stettner, stepson of conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, [testified](https://apnews.com/8536e1862eab462488afa06428fd9a90) before Mueller’s grand jury Thursday for about an hour. Prosecutors reportedly focused on questions about a computer belonging to Corsi that he “scrubbed” in the weeks leading up to Corsi’s subpoena to testify before the grand jury in late August. Corsi claims it was wiped so his wife could use it for her business and maintains that all files still exist on a backup drive. Two weeks ago, Corsi told [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/beta-story-container/Politics/mueller-plows-ahead-issuing-subpoenas-associates-conservative-commentator/story?id=60391636) his lawyer was writing to Mueller’s team to offer to give them the backup external hard drive.

&nbsp;

**Hush money?** The Washington Post [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/witness-in-special-counsel-probe-former-stone-associate-collected-payments-from-infowars-through-job-stone-arranged/2019/01/24/4dfa4300-1e57-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.443329921999) that for the past 6 months, Jerome Corsi has been receiving $15,000 a month from Infowars, where he previously worked as the websites Washington bureau chief. Mueller’s team has apparently been asking questions about the payments, suspecting they may have been made to ensure Corsi tailors his version of events regarding Wikileaks in a way favorable to Roger Stone (Stone is a co-host and frequent commentator on Infowars). 

* Infowars maintains that the payments were the remainder of Corsi’s contract, despite the fact that Corsi was fired in June 2018. 
* However, Corsi said after the Washington Post made inquiries about the payments last week, he learned from Alex Jones’s father, David, that the payments would stop - according to a legal complaint Corsi filed this week against The Post (see below).

&nbsp;

**Corsi’s suit.** Last week, Jerome Corsi [amended](https://lawandcrime.com/lawsuit/jerome-corsi-accuses-mueller-of-being-source-of-buzzfeed-report-ups-damages-in-lawsuit-to-1-5-billion/) his complaint against Mueller, the CIA, NSA, and related agencies. He made a number of new claims. First, Corsi stated that the Buzzfeed report that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress actually came from Mueller’s office, and Mueller issued a statement disputing the piece to cover up his own leak. Second, Corsi added Jeff Bezos, the Washington Post, and a WaPo reporter to the lawsuit for publishing an article about the $15,000 a month payments he has been receiving from Infowars. Third, Corsi claimed that Mueller is trying to ruin his book sales by pressuring Bezos’ Amazon not to sell his book (without any evidence of this). Finally, Corsi complained that the government illegally intercepted his text messages.

&nbsp;

#Mueller: Manafort

**Hearing.** On Friday, Manafort [appeared](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/mueller-says-paul-manafort-should-not-get-credit-cooperating-n962681) in court for a hearing on to address charges he lied to the grand jury, the FBI, and prosecutors. Mueller’s office told the judge Manafort should not get any credit for his cooperation due to these lies. His team stated they aren’t planning additional charges for lying, but Mueller’s office [reserves](https://twitter.com/ZoeTillman/status/1088815562069823494) the right to pursue other charges in the superseding indictment against Manafort. Manafort’s lawyers argued that he did not intentionally mislead investigators. The judge set a closed-door hearing to argue whether and how much Manafort lied for February 4.

&nbsp;

#Mueller: Cohen

**Tower plans.** Buzzfeed [reviewed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/here-are-the-trump-moscow-plans) “hundreds of pages of business documents, emails, text messages, and architectural plans” related to Trump Tower Moscow. Contradicting Rudy Giuliani’s statement that: the proposal was in the earliest stage,” and “no plans were ever made. There were no drafts. Nothing in the file.” The plan was for a glass skyscraper taller than any other building in Europe that would “yield profits in excess of $300 million.” 

* Buzzfeed: According to a finalized letter of intent signed by Donald Trump on Oct. 28, 2015, the tower would have “approximately 250 first class, luxury residential condominiums.” It would be located in Moscow City… The building would feature a luxury spa and fitness center  [Spa by Ivanka], a commercial component “consistent with the overall luxury level of the Property,” and an office space “consistent with Class A luxury office properties,” as well as “luxury” parking.
* The penthouse, worth $50 million, was to be given away for free to Putin himself. Cohen even discussed the idea with an aide to Putin’s press secretary. Buzzfeed: The hope was that the lavish gift would help grease the wheels, and in the process entice more Russian elites to move in. “My idea was to give a $50 million penthouse to Putin and charge $250 million more for the rest of the units,” Felix Sater told BuzzFeed News in November. “All the oligarchs would line up to live in the same building as Putin.”

&nbsp;

#Mueller: Other

**Mystery opponent.** On Tuesday, the Supreme Court [allowed](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/22/supreme-court-will-let-possible-mueller-company-file-papers-in-secret.html) the unknown foreign-owned company challenging a grand jury subpoena to file under seal an application for a stay in the subpoena. The grand jury is believed to be involved in Mueller’s investigation, but the secrecy surrounding the case has masked the participants’ identities. The company’s petition asking SCOTUS to consider its appeal of the subpoena was released, mostly redacted or sealed. A short unsealed portion stated that the subpoena should be lifted ""before it upsets foreign relations in a way that an American judicial decision never should."" Additionally, we [learned](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/politics/mueller-supreme-court/index.html) that the company is in fact wholly owned by a foreign government. 

&nbsp;

**NRA.** Former Trump aide Sam Nunberg [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/politics/mueller-nunberg-trump-campaign-nra/index.html) that Mueller asked him about the Trump campaign’s relationship with the NRA. Mueller asked him how Trump and his associates first started dealing with the NRA and how Trump came to speak at the NRA annual meeting in 2015. 

&nbsp;

#RUSSIA NEWS

**Sanction deal.** A new report last week contradicted the Trump administration’s claim that it had ensured Oleg Deripaska’s control EN+ Group was severed before lifting sanctions (which were officially eased over the weekend). The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-oligarchs-deal-for-sanctions-relief-is-sweeter-than-publicly-portrayed-document-suggests/2019/01/22/3c3d3a36-1e8a-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.cdd1fe2e3aa1) obtained a copy of the agreement, which revealed Deripaska, his ex-wife, ex-father-in-law, and a foundation Deripaska launched, “will together maintain well over 50 percent of the shares in En+ Group, the most influential of [the] three companies.” Thus, once shares in his companies rebound, Deripaska will benefit. The Russian bank VTB, aka [Putin’s piggy bank](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/andrei-kostin-russia-oligarch-putin-piggy-bank-vtb-moscow-financier-money-a8179416.html) and financier of proposed Trump Tower Moscow, [received](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-russian-sanctions.html) shares worth $800 million. 

* WaPo: The agreement also outlines new ownership stakes for Rusal that appear to largely protect the holdings of another sanctioned Russian oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg, and his business partner Leonard Blavatnik, who holds U.S. citizenship and has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Senate Republicans and a million to Trump’s inaugural committee.
* Sen. Mark Warner: “My concern all along was that Deripaska would retain control over his companies and benefit personally from this deal. This new report suggests that those concerns were valid and that the situation may even have been worse than we thought.”
* Note ~~sanctions~~ tariffs on Canadian aluminum *are still in effect.* Yet, sanctions on Russian aluminum producers have been significantly reduced.

&nbsp;

**Skripal sanctions.** The Trump administration [still has not](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-admin-has-not-imposed-new-sanctions-russia-required-law-n962216) imposed the second round of sanctions on Russia for poisoning ex-spy Sergei Skripal last year. According to chemical weapons laws, Russia missed a deadline three months ago to provide “reasonable assurances” it won’t use chemical weapons again and to agree to inspections by the UN. Failing to do so by the deadline should have triggered a second, harsher round of sanctions. The EU has already initiated these sanctions, but the US Treasury Department insists there “is no deadline” for imposing sanctions.

&nbsp;

**Tour canceled.** Russian pop star and facilitator of the Trump Tower meeting, Emin Agalarov, [canceled](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/21/politics/emin-agalarov-cancels-concert-tour/index.html) his four-city US tour after failing to reach a deal with Mueller and Congress “over the contours of his testimony.” Agalarov’s lawyer stated his client wanted to appear voluntarily and wouldn’t agree to be subpoenaed, because it would put him in legal jeopardy if he did not fully respond to requests. His lawyer further stated, “he has nothing to hide.” 

&nbsp;

**Deripaska & the escort.** Russian anti-corruption activist Alexey Navalny [revealed](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/01/21/leaked-audio-records-allegedly-show-how-oleg-deripaska-s-associates-plotted-the-arrest-of-the-sex-trainers-who-claimed-to-have-russiagate-dirt-on-him) that he knows of recordings of telephone calls involving oligarch Oleg Deripaska discussing the need to lock up Belarusian escort Anastasia Vashukevich, aka “Nastya Rybka.” Vashukevich posted video on social media of herself on a yacht with Deripaska and the Russian deputy prime minister, Sergei Prikhodko, in 2016. It wasn’t until Navalny gathered her posts into an investigative video alleging corruption in February 2018 that she was arrested while in Thailand. The recordings capture Deripaska and his associates suggesting Vashukevich’s group be arrested for illegal business activities, since Thailand doesn’t imprison “sex trainers.”  Vashukevich’s group was indeed initially charged with illegal business activity; they were acquitted and charged instead with conducting illegal sex work.

* Vashukevich pleaded guilty and was meant to be deported to her home country of Belarus. However, she was arrested during a layover in Moscow for prostitution. She pleaded not guilty and proclaimed she was being framed, but she also apologized personally to Deripaska, saying, “Mr. Deripaska, please forgive me. I was just a tool and people used me.”
* While in a Thai jail, Vashukevich [claimed](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/europe/anastasia-vashukevich-released-russia-intl/index.html) to have evidence that Russia interfered in the US election and asked the US for help in exchange for handing it over. The FBI reportedly attempted to schedule a meeting with her but Thai officials would not allow it.

&nbsp;

#CONGRESS

**Obstruction.** House Republican leadership has [delayed](https://www.thedailybeast.com/dithering-gop-stalls-houses-new-trump-russia-probe?source=articles&via=rss) naming Republican members to the new House Intelligence Committee, preventing the committee from conducting any official work. Because of a congressional rule, both parties need full representation on the committees before business like hearings or votes can begin. After public pressure, GOP Rep. McCarthy [stated](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/mccarthy-gop-will-name-members-of-the-house-intelligence-committee-next-week) he will appoint the Republican members “next week.” 

* According to Chairman Adam Schiff, the highest priority when the committee starts its session is to release transcripts of previous testimony to Mueller’s office. This will allow Mueller to press (or refer) charges against any individuals who lied under oath.

&nbsp;

**Delayed testimony.** Michael Cohen [postponed](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/michael-cohen-postpone-congressional-testimony-threats-family) his testimony before the House, previously scheduled for February 7. Cohen’s lawyer said “threats against his family” from Trump and Giuliani persuaded Cohen, his wife, and kids it was best to delay his appearance. The attorney, Lanny Davis, continued: “The president has terrorized someone who wanted to tell the truth before Congress.” In contrast, Trump [told](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-23/cohen-delays-house-testimony-citing-threats-from-trump-giuliani) reporters, “I would say he’s been threatened by the truth.”

* The Democratic chairmen of the House Oversight, Intelligence, and Judiciary Committees called Cohen’s safety concerns “completely legitimate” and stated they still intend on getting Cohen’s testimony at some point. “We will not let the President’s tactics prevent Congress from fulfilling our constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities,” they wrote. Cohen is set to report to jail on March 6th to serve his three year sentence.
* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-23/cohen-delays-house-testimony-citing-threats-from-trump-giuliani): Cohen friend Donny Deutsch, an advertising executive, said that Cohen has been increasingly worried that Trump would retaliate against him by further attacking his family if he testified. “He was panicked. He was like ‘he’s going after my father-in-law. Are my children next?’” Deutsch said on MSNBC on Jan. 18. Deutsch said Cohen told him “you have no idea what this man is capable of.""

&nbsp;

**Senate testimony.** A day after Cohen postponed his appearance before the House, the Senate Intelligence Committee [subpoenaed](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/24/politics/michael-cohen-subpoenaed-senate-intelligence-committee/index.html) Cohen to testify in mid-February. Cohen’s lawyer stated his client will comply with the request. Note that Senate Intel hearings occur behind closed doors, perhaps lessening the concerns regarding Cohen’s and his family’s safety. A date has yet to be set.

**Clearances.** The House Oversight Committee [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/23/politics/house-oversight-committee-investigation-security-clearances/index.html) it has launched an investigation into the White House’s handling of security clearances. A day after the announcement, [news broke](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/officials-rejected-jared-kushner-top-secret-security-clearance-were-overruled-n962221) that career security experts rejected the clearances of at least 30 people but were overruled by their supervisor, Carl Kline (appointed by Trump May 2017). One of these individuals whose clearance was originally rejected was Jared Kushner; his FBI background check raised questions “about his family's business, his foreign contacts, his foreign travel and meetings he had during the campaign.”

* After Kline gave Kushner top-secret clearance, Kushner sought even higher level access to ‘sensitive compartmented information’ (SCI), which is comprised of the government’s most sensitive secrets. Unlike top secret clearance, the CIA determines who gets SCI level access. Kline recommended Kushner to the CIA for SCI, but the officers “balked.” One CIA officer called the White House security division questioning how Kushner even got a top-secret clearance. As far as we know, Kushner never for permission to review SCI material. However, Trump has the power to override the rules and grant Kushner access. 
* ""What you are reporting is what all of us feared,"" said Brad Moss, a lawyer who represents persons seeking security clearances. ""The normal line adjudicators looked at the FBI report … saw the foreign influence concerns, but were overruled by the quasi-political supervisor.""

&nbsp;

**Joint probe.** The chairs of the House Intelligence and House Financial Services Committees, Reps. Schiff and Waters, are [planning](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/23/adam-schiff-maxine-waters-deutsche-bank-1108140) a joint investigation into Deutsche Bank. Schiff and Waters believe the bank is the starting point for probing both Trump and Russian money laundering.

&nbsp;

**Bolton oversight.** The House Oversight Committee is also [investigating](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/23/687898389/house-oversight-panel-launches-inquiry-into-white-house-security-clearances) National Security Adviser John Bolton’s relationship with admitted Russian spy Maria Butina. In 2013, Bolton recorded a video for Butina’s Russian gun rights group - reportedly at the request of the NRA. Rep. Elijah Cummings asked the NRA on Wednesday to provide documents related to Bolton’s foreign contacts.

*Robert Foresman, a banker with ties to Russia attempted to get a position in the Trump administration, using producer Mark Burnett as a connection. Giuliani said Trump had conversations about the Trump Tower Moscow deal “throughout 2016,” and could have continued “until the election.” Giuliani also made mention of “tapes” in relation to Trump directing Cohen to lie, but backtracked when asked about it. Roger Stone was arrested Friday morning after Mueller charged him with 7 counts, including witness tampering & lying to Congress. Jerome Corsi’s stepson testified before Mueller’s grand jury Thursday. Mueller’s office told a judge that Manafort should not get any credit for his cooperation due to his alleged lies. Sam Nunberg told CNN that Mueller asked him about the Trump campaign’s relationship with the NRA.*

*The Trump administration lifted sanctions on Deripaska’s aluminum companies, despite a new report that Deripaska still stands to benefit greatly from the deal. The Trump administration still has not imposed the second round of sanctions on Russia for poisoning ex-spy Sergei Skripal last year. Russian pop star and facilitator of the Trump Tower meeting, Emin Agalarov, canceled his four-city US tour after failing to reach a deal with Mueller and Congress “over the contours of his testimony.”*

*House Republican leadership has delayed naming Republican members to the new House Intelligence Committee, preventing the committee from conducting any official work. Michael Cohen postponed his testimony before the House, citing threats against him and his family by Trump and his associates. The next day, the Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Cohen to testify in mid-February (closed-door). The House Oversight Committee announced it has launched an investigation into the White House’s handling of security clearances - career security experts rejected the clearances of at least 30 people (including Kushner) but were overruled by their supervisor in the White House office.*

So much of what I dislike about modern survivor is how they handle the finales. Survivor Finales used to be a special event. At my house, it was the equivalent of the Super Bowl. Every season culminates with this episode, but the magic of it has been lost in recent seasons. 

1) I really miss the finales being on Sunday's. At first I didn't think it make much of a difference that finales now are on Wednesday, but there is a lost sense of magic. Finales were a special episode that aired on a different day from regular episodes. But compared to everything else I'm about to mention, this is a minor problem

2) I DESPISE 6 person finales. Finales need to be double boots. No more, no less. Single boot finales are extremely boring (a la Caramoan) while triple boot finales are way to rushed and it cuts into the reunion show time. This is a really egregious trend that needs to stop

3) The Rites of Passage. A lot of people have mixed opinions on this because it doesn't have anything to do with the game, but to me it serves as a tribute the season that we have just watched for the past four months. But most importantly, it builds up the hype for the epic Final Immunity Challenge. Which perfectly segues into

4) The Final Immunity Challenge. The FIC used to be an epic thing to watch. This was the final challenge of the season that determines whose in the FTC. These challenges used to be so incredible. Remember when Tom and Ian spent 11 hours on a buoy in Palau? Or how about that grueling, dark FIC in Thailand? Nowadays, FIC's are nothing special. In fact, theres nothing differentiating them from a typical challenge. And when you consider the fire making twist, the stakes at FIC aren't nearly has high as they used to be. Which brings me to

5) The Final Four Fire Making Twist. There is nothing new for me to add that hasn't already been said. Get rid of it!

6) The Final Tribal Council. I know I'm not alone in this sentiment but I hate the open forum style they have used since Game Changers. I want to hear each juror give their own speech to the finalists. I always used to look forward to what outrageous things jurors would say to the finalists. But under this new format, we will never get such classic speeches such as Rats and Snakes, Corinne's dead father speech, or Trish making Tony look like a little dog. I mean, just last season, wouldn't it have been entertaining as hell to watch the jurors one by one dismantle Angelina? 

&#x200B;

And finally, the biggest problem of all

NO MORE LIVE INTERRUPTIONS DURING THE FINALE!!!!!! I can't say this enough. It is infuriating to watch the show go from the episode to the live audience back to episode again. I don't need to hear Probst talking to the audience. I don't give a crap what some dumb kid thinks is going to happen. All this completely ruins the pace of the episode and worst of all it is a massive waste of time. It's just so Probst can hear himself talk more. One of my favorite things about finales used to be watching Probst leaving FTC with the votes and the show goes live and there is a studio audience and you see the players all cleaned up. It was such an incredible thing to watch but that is no longer special in modern finales. 

&#x200B;

Other big things that are worth mentioning include:

\- Spring seasons need to have their finale in NYC like they used to. Fall seasons were always in LA and spring was in NYC. But now it's all in LA and it sucks. I don't know what it is, but there is something exciting about the reunion being at the Ed Sullivan Theatre that doesn't happen when the show is at one of the millions of soundstages in LA

\- Live bands at the reunion. I am a music fan and I always used to enjoy watching the live band jam out to an acoustic version of ancient voices when the winner was revealed. Ever since they canned Russ Landau, the bands have been noticeably absent from finales

\-  Show the winner's hometown reaction. I always loved seeing how the winner's hometown reacts after they win. It offers a glimpse into the winner's real life and adds to the excitement that somebody just one a million dollars"
36,Are people happy moving from HCOL to LCOL area?,442,9vh8ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9vh8ut/are_people_happy_moving_from_hcol_to_lcol_area/,521,1541736262.0,"Hello. Throwaway account.

I am curious whether any of you have executed on the FIRE strategy of starting out in a HCOL area, making enough money to RE, and then relocating to a LCOL?

My partner and I are mid-30s, reached FI a few years ago, and trying to figure out where to spend our next chapter. We have a small child and we're currently in a VHCOL area and considering several places to move to in the next year, some of which are also HCOL and some are M- or LCOL.

We used to have this idyllic view of living in a town that's small, quiet, full of nature, and far from the competitive rat race. We could buy a nice house for cheap. However, I'm beginning to think that, being in my 30s, liking to work, and historically having lived near bustling metropolitan areas, I would find very little fulfilling in a small, peaceful town.

I'd love to learn from your experiences... specifically:

1. Ultimately, were you happy moving from a HCOL area to a LCOL area?
2. What do you miss about the HCOL?
3. What did you think you would miss from the HCOL but don't actually?
4. What kinds of things did you have to do to ""adjust""?

Thanks!

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

Wow, thanks for all the responses. I wasn't expecting so much interest. I'll clarify a few things and also highlight my main takeaways so far from the discussion.

First, clarifications:

The main reason we are considering moving to another VHCOL place (NYC) from our current VHCOL place (SF) is because the majority of our friends live there and that's also where most of my career network is. I personally also just really like the city. If we do this though, I would have to keep working, likely in a job with a lot of hours. This might be fine since I like working, but I wouldn't be able to see my child whenever I want.

The main reasons we ware considering MCOL places is to get away from the rat race, be around more nature, and get a house to start getting settled in. If we do this, I could stop working or work very sparingly and have time to spend with my child during his golden years.

&#x200B;

Takeaways

1. Going abroad never really crossed my mind but now I am intrigued, particularly in places that offer free or low-cost graduate degrees. This would solve the visa issue and I suspect wouldn't require nearly as much time as a job would, so we'd be able to enjoy our time abroad while still tapping into a network. Maybe we do this soon, or maybe we do this in a few years when the child is a little older. I've heard great things about Berlin and German education.
2. I don't personally care much for concerts, museums, cinemas, and definitely not bars. They're fine, but we don't even really take advantage of them here, so I think most decent MCOL places would be perfectly adequate. Great ethnic food, though, seems to be a very real concern.
3. Figuring out where to raise my child is a huge factor. There were several posts that pointed out that living in BFE type places will not give him the type of STEM or cultural opportunities that I would want. However, I also don't want to deprive him of the joy of being in nature, so that's a dilemma. Maybe we could live in NYC and just drive to Vermont for a weekend every month.
4. Having close friends accessible (within a couple hours) is important to me. The question is whether it'd be better to be close to our existing friends, or try to build a network in a new place where we don't know anyone. I think if I were working in a job, that would be fine, but if we just stay retired, it would be hard.

Hope that this discussion was as helpful for some others as much as it was for me. Thanks again!

---

I knew it was a bad neighborhood when I first moved in, but there was nothing to be done about that. What else could I afford on my salary? It was either this, or pay $800 a month to share someone's closet on the Upper West side. There were bars on all the windows, cockroaches in the cabinets, and drug dealers conveniently located on every corner. Dizzy adapted to the new location quite well, though. I'd rescued her from a shelter two years ago and I was the only human that she trusted, so she was quite happy to not have any roommates. She wasn't at all worried by the nightly sound of gunfire and wailing police sirens. 

Dizzy had been an outdoor feral cat in her past life. She was a tough son of a bitch, though you'd never know it from seeing her flop on her back and ask for belly rubs whenever I walked through the door. There was still some part of her that still longed to go out there and hunt. It hadn't been possible in our last place, but she managed to find a hole in the wall of the new place just large enough for her to sneak through and get outside. I kind of panicked when it first happened, given how many shady Chinese food restaurants were nearby. But Dizzy always came back, happy as a clam and carrying a little present for me. She was such a good provider: sometimes I'd get trash, or freshly killed rats larger than some of the smaller dogs you see carried in purses in the garment district. But sometimes... well, I don't know where Dizzy got it, but she started bringing back cash in neat little rubber-band-wrapped stacks. I hadn't intentionally trained a cat burglar, but I couldn't deny that the little extra bit helped. I always made sure to buy her a can of the good cat food with it as a reward for doing her part. 

A few weeks after the money, she started bringing home little baggies full of drugs. Usually just weed, but sometimes harder stuff. Coke, heroine, pills... I didn't want anything to do with that scene, so I'd throw them out immediately. I didn't want cops to find that on me somehow, and I *certainly* didn't want the nearby gangs to think that I had been somehow stealing from them. I told Dizzy not to bring those back anymore... but she's a cat. It's not like she could understand what I said. I tried boarding up her exit hole, but nothing worked: every day I'd come home to find it open again. How she managed to move an entire stack of textbooks is far beyond me. I was just dreading the day that someone would find her stealing their stash and follow her back to my place, and I'd come home to a whole gang in my living room or something.

I worked late on Christmas Eve. Everyone else at the store had chosen to take vacation all at the same time, and I was the only one staying in the city over the holidays. Mostly because I was the only one who couldn't afford to go anywhere. Naturally Mr. Henderson decided to keep the store open to 11 despite how short-staffed we were. So I found myself stepping off the train at the dead of midnight facing a long, cold walk back home. And I wasn't alone.

""Hey man, you lost?"" A voice called from behind me. I quickened my pace and shot a glance over my shoulder. Two figures wearing dark hooded sweatshirts were walking behind me with a confident swagger. I kept my head down and scanned the street, looking for anyone else around who could potentially help me. No luck; the stores were all closed for the holiday, and no one else wanted to be out on the streets this late either. I'd never seen anywhere in NYC so desolate.

""Hey, you got a light?"" one of them called out. 

""We just want a smoke,"" the other said. I broke out into a full run, and I could hear their sneakers pounding the sidewalk after me. And then another dark figure stepped out of an alleyway right in front of me, holding some sort of large blunt object right in my path. He was at least two feet taller than me, and built like a mountain. One swing of that bat would knock me head clean off my shoulders. I was cornered.

""How much you go on you?"" they asked, checking the streets for any sign of cops coming. ""Give us your cell phone too.""

""Please,"" I said, holding out my hands and backing up against a streetlight. ""I don't have anythi...""

""Oh *shit*!"" one of them said. He pulled off his hood and came closer, studying me under the light. ""Shit, man, this is Big D's boy!""

The others looked at me like I was a circus freak. ""You sure?"" one of them said. The one who'd first identified me reached into *his* jacket pocket, and pulled a slip of paper or something out, and held it up next to my face. I was able to glance over and see that it was actually a picture of me. The one from my sister's wedding that I kept in a drawer by my bed... how had they gotten that? Had someone broken into my apartment??

""Fuck, man!"" I could see panic in their eyes as they each traded glances, then they all turned back to me. ""Listen, we didn't mean nothing. Here, why don't we walk you home? Make sure you get there all safe."" The mountain with the baseball bat loomed over me, and as he took off his hood I could actually see *sheer terror* on his face. All I could do was nod in response. They fanned out like a Secret Service detail and guided me back to my apartment. I was too scared and confused to ask how they already knew the way there. 

""We're sorry again,"" one called as I stepped toward the door and got out my keys. ""Please don't tell Big D what happened!""

""Uh... I won't..."" I said slowly. I didn't know who Big D was, so telling him was kind of impossible anyway. They stayed on the sidewalk and watched me as I quickly opened the door; I was still worried that this was all some sort of trick to get me to open the door to my place and then they'd rush in and rob me. Not that I had anything worth stealing. But they maintained their distance, so I slipped in and immediately locked the door behind me.

""Mrow!"" Dizzy was waiting, as always. Poor girl had been waiting for her dinner for hours. I rubbed her head, still in daze from what had happened. We went into the kitchen, where I saw her latest present waiting on the counter: a big stack of bills, at least $600. 

""Dizzy... you..."" What had those guys all said? *Big D*? She rubbed against my leg, twitching her tail and looking up at me with wide eyes. ""Did you...""

*No way. That's just crazy*.

""Never mind. Let's get you a can of food, Diz.""

Or Thanks or Tom Hanks has been Infecting just about just about every “fringe” event of sub-series of conspiracy communities. With all the hoopla surrounding him currently I wanted do dive back a couple years to some of the down right ODD things in connection with Mr Hanks.    


From the top I will mention the various point where Tom or connected parties showed up in the particular research I was doing.     
    
  First big series of hanks sync weaving was to do when I was researching the Mandela effect and the prominent position Hanks has as a Nexus of effects.      
    
  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/7lfka2/an\_exercise\_followed\_by\_examples\_word\_association/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/7lfka2/an_exercise_followed_by_examples_word_association/)    
    
  If you are unfamiliar with the Mandela effect then essentially is a a series of pop culture points that have been altered or a wide collection of people have noticed a change from their memory of a particular specific point.   


Weather or not it is faulty human memory or something else is up for debate but what is not up for debate is the rampant and creative ways the Mandela effects connect to Tom Hanks.     
    
  I made this post as a way of explaining how to play with words and symbolism, ways of looking at things as a puzzle.   


Here is a bit of what that looks like.     


Mandel means Almond, An almond is the Mandorla, Mandelas prisoner number is 46664 but used to be 4664 according to some. Cern is said to be responsible or at least involved in some way and their video “Happy” Has Both Nelson Mandela and 4664 (the occluded Prisoner number) Cerns logo has the 666 theme as well as being Mandela effected as well and the effect added a mandorla. Cern built the WWW or 666 vav vav vav 777/ which is also the Monster energy drink logo. LOGOS changing LOGOS is the WORD and the thing that was with God during creation. The levels of fractal metaphor are stunning to me. Staggeringly beautiful not just in their existence but the fact that conscious minds can behold it.   
    
   Isnt it funny that Jaws (villian) and Jaws(shark) are both to do with The mouth and teeth and the ME involves braces... And that the dolly/jaws scene had them mirror each others smiles, like in snow whites mirror mirror. and that the actress who plays dolly is Blanche Ravelec. Blanche means White/pure. As does Clarice In the Silence of the lions/lamb.... loins fruit of the womb. froot looms loony looms..... the double 00 thing oo like eyes that see.  

  
   Sally fields name is effected, her famous Oscar speech is effected, she costars in forest gump which has curious George as a key element and sally field being the one Tom hanks is quoting, he would then be involved in another ME later on. And sally fields brother works at cern... Tom hank is also Woody and Says “Theirs a Snake in my Boots” which contextually makes no sense and reminds us of the Fields not having a plural.. Another way to look at that is “Boots” could be interpreted as a word.. and the Snake is S s is a snake a snake hissessssss los of ssess lol The s on the end can also denote possession (again more S'es) possession is ownership and ownership is shackling and oppressive. You may also be reminded of Field of Dreams “If you build it THEY/HE will come (who is he?) HE is right in the middle of THEY TY thank you... and back to the start with the fact sally fields acceptance speech was her saying thank you to the academy.  


  
   This may appear to be nonsense or gibberish but if you had the time and knew the things I was referencing then you would be able to see the connections.   


Of Course this is just nothing as it is. But then the universe nods to us this genuine morsel.

I started looking into this movie because of the notable Calling Card that Hanx has developed on twitter. He has posted pictures of lone gloves, shoes and other discarded or lost objects. Its kind of his “Thing”   


I first had this brought to my attention due too my research into the Death of Issac Kappy.  Which is another completely bonkers rabbithole that covers Epstein and leads to the death of researcher Tracey Twymin.   
    
  Kappy had called out some folks in his various videos before his death.

  Whelp this is new too me. Damn strange , The way hes propped up and the fact the time stamp in the video is 2 mins before he is noted as jumping off the bridge as there was supposedly a group of 6 or 7 teenagers on the bridge attempting to stop him.   


Did anyone notice the song playing in the background.”When Im gone” by 3 doors down....

  Why is this anything pertaining to Tom Hanks?

  Tom hanks posted a picture of a discarded glove with the caption “Historic Route 66. Roadkill? I hope not! Hanx. “  


This was on 4-4-2018 and 40 days(5 weeks 5 days) before Kappys death on Route 66.  


2 posts later on the day that Kappy died Hanks posts

  It looks like Hanx twitter is where a lot the juicy conspiratorial coincidences lie.   


Make not of all of the posts made from 3-13-20 and beyond and you will see that there is a pattern to the posting style not present before.   


Before 3-11-20 he posted inside the ap using the twitter posting ap, and writing the post and attatching  a picture.   


After 3-11-20 all of his posts where he writes a blurb are pictures of text with pictures embedded

  With this seeming like the post he had been destined to post this whole time. The lone glove in bio-hazard waste bin.

Now we are in the year of the RAT. Which is quite heavily intoned with the black plague     
    
  [https://chinesenewyear.net/](https://chinesenewyear.net/)    
    
  The phrase ""black death"" (*mors nigra*) was used in 1350 by Simon de Covino or Couvin, a Belgian astronomer, who wrote the poem ""On the Judgment of the Sun at a Feast of Saturn"" (*De judicio Solis in convivio Saturni*), which attributes the plague to a [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astrology)) of Jupiter and Saturn.    
  Hmm that is indeed interesting as I am aware that there is a Great Conjunction this very year, the year of the Rat.  And the Year of the Coronavirus.  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction)    
    
  This conjunction is taking place on the solstice which is quite significant.   
    
  May-31-2000 was our last great conjunction and can you see how the world is so much different from that point in time. And we can suspect that this point in 2020 is yet another turning point into a “New Normal”  


Note that Dante Alighieri was very involved with astrology and had a penchant for the Great conjunctions in particular. And He was the inspiration of the movie INFERNO with Tom hanks trying to prevent a global outbreak intended to reduce  the population to save the planet.

Here is a point of note. I am browsing this wiki for the first time and I am seeing this nugget.  


Pope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and [Cante dei Gabrielli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cante_dei_Gabrielli) da [Gubbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gubbio)  was appointed [*podestà*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podest%C3%A0) of the city.

Podesta really..... I had no idea this name meant anything, really never looked into it, even though I have an obsession with names and the meanings of said names, I had not sought this.

What is this? 6201.................... 6 games 201 points...... bill signed into law the day you and Rita Wilson tested positive for corona virus in Australia with your CORONA typewriter?   
    
  So we have a grand convergence of coincidence. 1 with event 201 coming before HR 6201 is passed and 2 with the rummy game hanks played with his wife referencing said bill.

Babaloo Mandel? Baloo and Mandel, for real? Mandel like the Mandel effect and the Mandela effect. And Baloo like the character from the jungle book who is not wearing coconuts as a bra anymore?  


Look up “Baloo Mandela effect” and you'll see what I mean.  


This stood out too me because of course Tom hanks connection too the Mandela effect through notably the Most Mandela effects attributed to his name and works. But I didn't think it was 'Enough” to share here.   


So after seeing Madonna and Tom hanks connected via the Corona Typewriter I googled . “Tom Hanks and Madonna”

Im getting long winded and as always there is more left out then I have presented it too you as their really is no way of condensing this so that you acquire the full picture.   


I end with a question?!!!   


What was Madonnas name before she changed it too MADONNA for the purposes of being a star?

Tom hanks wife is Rita Wilson...................... Wilson you say?! Hmmm well the vollyball in CAST AWAY must have been named after her... right????   
    
   In the film, Wilson the [volleyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_(ball)) serves as Chuck Noland's [personifie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personification)d [friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_friend) and only companion during the four years that Noland spends alone on a deserted [island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island). Named after the volleyball's manufacturer, [Wilson Sporting Goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Sporting_Goods), the character was created by screenwriter [William Broyles, Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Broyles,_Jr.) While researching for the film, he consulted with professional survival experts, and then chose to deliberately strand himself for one week on an isolated beach in the [Gulf of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California), to force himself to search for water and food, and obtain his own shelter. During this time, a volleyball washed up on shore. This was the inspiration for the film's inanimate companion. From a screenwriting point of view, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a one-person-only situation    
     
   Here is a prime example of synchronicity that when brought up to someone not exposed to these ideas they would come back at you with “Well its prolly because his wife was named Wilson” and then the door is shut for them they don't have to take on any new ideas or modify there existing foundation of reality.  If you tell anyone a small peculiar fact then they inevitably try and “Solve” what you just told them. They have to organize the new information in a way that doesn't cause uncomfortability or stress. The human brain seems to have an Autonomic response to new information that doesn't jive with the world view that person has built up over the years.    
     
   Mention any Mandela effect and someone will try and come up with a reason to ignore what you are presenting to them. The effects themselves are in such mundane places that it doesn't seem to have much weight to the average Joe.    
     
   It seems like many people fall into the logical fallacy of the “Wisdom of the Crowd” Even if they have no concept of what this is they may still fall into its tenants.    
     
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom\_of\_the\_crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)    
     
   Take any of the biggest conspiracies out there. The moon landing, 9-11, flat earth. The bigger and more wide spanning the conspiracy then the more “Well, if this is real then people would have said something about it” “You couldn't keep a secret that big” “Somebody in my life would have told me if X was True/False.”    
   Have you seen the meme from xfiles with the poster Mulder has saying “I want to believe” with a flying saucer on it. Thats what this is like. But the train goes both ways. “I want” and “I dont want. “

   Both of these Mantras play out in our heads unbeknownst to our recognition. A duel play on what we wish reality to be and what we wish it not to be. As want and unwant are dualistic sides of the same coin.  For someone that believes 9-11 was an inside job. “I want to believe” that I among all these other people on this planet found out that this large sector of society has been duped and I am one of the few people smart enough to have figured it out.    
     
   For someone who thinks 9-11 conspiracy theorists are insane. “ I dont want to believe I have been duped by the establishment and that everything I have been taught and all the people that I love have been duped into believing an untruth.”    
     
   I think this is mainly something that stems from our human need for others to identify with and a tribe to call home. And to have our beliefs echoed by another group. To be acknowledged as a contributor to the paradigm and to feel validated by others that feel the same way.    
     
   Its like we are innately narcissistic creatures who love our own images. We find those most similar to us and we just stare at each other reflecting the same ideas and producing a greater dived between US and THEM.What it comes down to is life's great mystery. Which takes shape in questions we ask ourselves:  ” Why do I exist?” “Why is reality a thing instead of a non-thing?” “What is my purpose?”    
     
   Instead of “what is my purpose?” it becomes “Is there even a purpose?”    
     
   Mainstream elements give us Relativity, The Big Bang, and Evolution.    
     
   If a human delves into and absorbs these tenants of culture, then one may come to the conclusion that reality is the result of a freak accident of random number of infinite forces coming together and creating everything you know and love and think and do. That it is all a fluke and you are just lucky..... but luck doesn't exist because this is a random universe and nothing lies deeper than surface exploration.    
     
   To identify Self you must also have the Other. The contrast creates the existence of a thing.Imagine 2 worlds, one of infinite shadow and one of infinite light. The one of infinite shadow would be a black slate and the world of light a white slate. Without contrast everything is nothing. Sense without the lack of sense is Nonsense. A world of pure sound or silence is a world where sound isn't a thing that exists.  If you ask the question. “What is a thing” the answer would be the inverse of its opposite. What is an exhale. It is the inverse of an inhale. But what is that? It is a see saw..... seeing and after seeing sawing. SAW because it WAS. Its like pIng pOng In and Out IO overlapped is the symbol for power. On/Off.  Imagine a hero without a villain. The story of Batman is a prime example of the balancing force of the universe. Without the Joker he would have never experienced the trauma to become the batman, its very possible that if the joker had not killed his parents that he would not have had fear in the cave with the bats. Joker was the primeval creation force alchemizing the batman into existence.    
     
   And then you ask would the Joker have done what he did if he didn't have a nemesis to combat against... a force to emphasize his existence    
     
   This reality/ game seems like a puzzle of disCERNment. That the presence of so many untruths shows us the massive amounts of truths that can be yielded. The shadows can show us where the light lies.

  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s\_Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game)   


The book is a story of a dystopian future where children are raised on video games and are chosen based on their aptitude to be brought into the military and as a part of their training they do a series of “Wargames”  via simulations systems and Haptic feedback suits for realism. SPOILER ALERT! The simulations they were performing were actual drone battle missions where they were killing actual sentient creatures.     


The psychology of getting kids to perform against actual foes with the knowledge that it was all a game made them more proficient in their duty to kill.    


Ok lets reel it back for a     
    
  TLDR.   
    
  Tom hanks is involved or a focal point in the Mandela effect phenomenon present in Forrest Gump Life is/.was like a box of chocolates, Apollo 13 Houston we have/we've had a problem, Woody from toy story says “There's a snake in my boot/s ,Momma from Forrest Gump is played by sally field/s whose name is considered a Mandela effect and has a famous Oscar speech that is commonly attributed to the Mandela effect and Sally Fields brother in real life is a scientist at CERN. CERN  makes a video set too Pharrells Happy that is filmed at Cern and a scientist holds up signs saying Bond# (Barry Nelson) and Mandela underneath, also showing the number 4664     
    
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46664](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46664)    
    
  Tom hanks then turns CERN back on after a failure that had occurred. He did this in honor of a movie Angels and Demons whos sequel INFERNO has Hanks catch a virus set to be a worldwide pandemic for the purposes of population control for the greater good. In Nov of 2019 one month before the first documented case of Novel Coronavirus Event 201 is hosted in  NYC by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. And on 3-11-2020 the same day Hanks and Rita announce they are infected with Corona virus, after bringing a Corona typewriter all the way to Australia. Then Hanks announces his wife's score of 6 games 201 points. When 6201 if you google it will get you one thing.  


[https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201)   


Hanks is called out in a video also calling out Epstein and others involved in the underground trafficking of children, This person is then killed/died/epstiened on route 66 which Tom hanks Tweets about.   


There is some funky stuff going on in the world and to be blunt there are 3 options. And then variations between those 3 options.   
    
  The extremes are   


1. This is all orchestrated and everything presented through the public is controlled/filtered and dispensed with one purpose. All news media and things that people talk about are intricately put together to share some underlying puzzle.  


Ways this could be feasible: this is a simulation and everything is preordained and put in place with no free will to the occupants in the simulation.   


Ways it couldn't be feasible. Barring a simulation it just would not cut it to have any sort of person or group in charge of such a thing, its too well orchestrated for human hands.   


I suppose a god of the realm in control of such things could perform such a feat..... but why?  


2. This is all the universe playing a coincidence game, a red herring game of sorts to keep some busy and others asleep.  Like if Tom hanks really got the itch to bring his Corona typewriter and he and his wife did actually play games of Gin Rummy that resulted in the 6 games 201 points with Event 201 being finished and HR 6201 just passing the same day they are infected with coronavirus.   


This is just one facet of the coincidental underlying tapestry that paints itself underneath human activity.   


Within this post I detail some stellar findings/coincidences that bear repeating here.

What are the odds that Wilson the volleyball is not named after Rita Wilson, his wife who kept her last name. But is instead named because the Writer stranded himself on an island and a Wilson Volleyball washed up onshore. This is the type of coincidence that bars any human forethought or knowledge to arranging. One of those universal winks in the form of syncs.   
    
    
  Look for my post history and you will find hundreds of WTF how is this a coincidence facts that could be both coincidence/divine providence/ or the will of man.  


Oh yeah and the 3rd Extreme way of looking at this data I have presented here and in the past is to just shut the door and say.  


“Nothing” none of this means anything at all and you are just thinking too much or looking too deep.   


The most likely is a synergy of these 3 points. There maybe a controlling organization or AI program controlling the media and news, film and music.  But there is most likely a clever universal side of things projecting the ironic in these peculiar times. And im sure some of this is just digging to deep as everything is intrinsically connected .   


What cant be stated is the data presented is incorrect(unless it is,im not perfect) it is our interpretation of the data that differs, im not making any conclusions, im only discussing options and possibilities."
42,A bit of perspective on MetroTransit and the lightrail,362,b3gul7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/b3gul7/a_bit_of_perspective_on_metrotransit_and_the/,126,1553113040.0,"Student at the U of M here currently spending Spring Break in New York City working on photography projects. Recently on this sub and some of the other twin cities subs 

I've been seeing a lot of complaints about how MetroTransit handling the light rail (smoking, fare skipping etc.) and as someone who rides the lightrail most days and has been using the NYC subway to get around I gained a lot of appreciation and respect for the lightrail. The light rail is clean, well marked and usually roughly on time. The NYC metro by comparison is filled with rats and trash, the cars are old and dilapidated and the time tables are non existent (i.e. you need an app or something to see when the next train is arriving at most stations). All of these complaints about the light rail suck, and stuff I wish wasn't an issue but id still ride the lightrail any day over the NYC metro. 

Of course this doesn't take into account ridership, budget, size and so many other variables. . . But I guess I just wanted to provide something to think about. I think the lightrail (and the bus system too) are managed extremely well considering their size and budgets and we should all cut them a little slack as they try and clean up some of the issues right now. 

Obligatory ""you might disagree"" which is cool, just my personal experience with the two systems. "
43,Alpha player here – My thoughts on The Division & why you should be excited as we approach the beta.,358,42q2oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/42q2oq/alpha_player_here_my_thoughts_on_the_division_why/,208,1453786060.0,"**TL; DR:** Reasons upon reasons as to why I loved the alpha and why you should be excited for the beta and avoid doom and gloom posts from players that haven't even played the game.

I will try and keep this as short as possible. 

I, like many of you have been excited for this game since it's reveal at E3 2013. I would say it's my most anticipated game in the last 2 years. When I had the opportunity to try the alpha I was cautiously optimistic. After a game is delayed a couple times it can either mean there are fundamental flaws with the gameplay that need to be re-worked or it's having some major technical issues that will require more development time to iron out; or so many think. After playing the alpha I was glad they waited and really worked on making this game something special. To me, the delays were to make sure this game is a masterpiece. There are so many things I loved about the alpha that I could write a book, but here are several things I took away after playing the alpha, why I'm excited to jump on the beta this week and why you should be too! 

---

**• The server stability and how very little bugs there were.** It was literally the most steady alpha or beta I've ever played (I've played a ton of alpha's on PC). I had one or two disconnects in probably 20-25 hours of play and the servers rarely lagged to me recollection. The game was surprisingly pretty bug-less (with the exception of a few here and there). In my opinion it could have passed for the final release of the game with how polished it was. These 2 reasons alone made me very thankful the developers took their time.

**• Grouping up with randoms/matchmaking system.** I met so many cool people using their matchmaking system (since proximity chat was bugged), it was truly a great experience venturing around NYC with a group and doing missions and venturing in to the Dark Zone. Also, the matchmaking system was perfect. It was so easy to find people to play with. If you fly solo or have a regular group of friends you will play with, try using the matchmaking system instead and head in to the DZ. It's almost a social experiment, you get to know what people are like just through playing in the DZ. It was super entertaining. 

**• The base of operations.** Though I only got a taste of it since only the medical wing allowed 1 main mission, it was such a cool concept to have a place to call your own, trade with vendors and do missions that upgrade your BoO. Very cool and unique concept.

**• The atmosphere.** They really nailed the immersion part of this game. The random AI walking around, random encounters, piles of bodies, stray dogs, rats, contaminated areas – it feels like a fallen NYC. Also, the snow storms and weather system is probably the best I've ever seen in a game, especially being that it's dynamic and always changing and not scripted. Also, no loading screens really, REALLY add to the immersion. I won't forget the first time I approached the DZ and I could hear explosions, gun fire and see flares popping off in the distance knowing that those are other players on the other side of the wall...without having to load in breaking that intense moment. Pretty incredible.

**• Hunting rogue players.** Every so often when someone goes rogue the DZ would become this huge team of friendly people hunting down the rogues. It was a pretty cool experience to see everyone ditch what they were doing to go hunt a rogue squad and then after the rogue's were killed, people go back to what they were doing. I've played a ton of Day Z and it felt so familiar to moments in that game but also very unique. Hard to explain...you'll get what I mean the first you go in the Dark Zone. It's intense.

**• Graphics.** I was pleasantly surprised by the detail and the graphics, especially being that it was an alpha and sometimes they don't include all the textures to keep file size down. I know there has been much talk of a ""downgrade"", but for a console, I thought this game looked fantastic. 

**• Gunplay and mechanics.** If you have played the Splinter Cell games or RB6 Vegas 1 & 2 then you will feel right at home in The Division. The cover system felt soooo good in the alpha. It didn't take me long at all to get used to the controls. The guns and shooting felt great too, the recoil was more on the realistic side and the sound design for the weapons is fantastic. Also, being that it's a 3rd-person shooter it may take some of you a short time to get good with your aim if you're used to FPS's.

---

This post is for those of you feeling overwhelmed by so many posts in this sub that are doom and gloom from people that haven't even played the game. I put in around 25 hours time, and I can say without a doubt that this is the game I had hoped it would be and more. Massive and Ubisoft have done a great job with The Division. 



**Happy Beta launch week people! See you in the Dark Zone!**


---

**EDIT 1:** There are some members of the community that are accusing me as being part of the Massive/Ubisoft marketing team posting on their behalf to drive pre-order sales and to sell ""bullshit"". This couldn't be further from the truth, I hold no stake in those companies nor am I here trying to convince anyone to pre-order the game. I played Watch Dogs (meh) and have encountered the same mess many of you did with games Ubisoft has put out the last few years. All I am doing is informing the community of the positive experiences I have had with the alpha. Please feel free to make an informative decision on pre-ordering, and most importantly, wait until after you try the beta to do so (or do whatever you want)! That is all."

I am not complaining about gentrification -- gentrification happens. I am complaining about the fact that we have watched Bloomberg turn this city into an economic tourist trap where transience is awarded, landlords get away with rat problems, overpriced produce is bruised,  stores don't even turn on their fucking fridge -- I have bought three -- THREE packs of moldy cheese in the last week. THREE! 

Ok. This is a bit ranty. I know the obvious snarky response would be: Well move. Sure, I may be able to move elsewhere and get a job. I don't want to, this is my home, I am a taxpaying citizen, and furthermore, there are people who *can't.*

Edit 1: Holy fuck wow, thanks for your responses! I wrote this with a momentary fury - a primal response from looking at my ConEd bill. I did not know so many people would get involved (and subsequently school me on microeconomics.) We can talk economics as much as we want, but economics is not a philosophy. We can, through policy, shift market incentives that may make living in this town more sustainable. My point about produce: im not just whining over a bruised apple, it is that this apple cost me $2, and that a decent grocery store with a fair price point has no place to be in the city, it is an unsustainable business model.

The city needs to either drop the costs to landlords, through taxes, water, electricity delivery. Or subsidize to say the least. They need to subsidize the rents of people who are *middle class* as well. Cities are beautiful things, cities keep our carbon footprint lower exponentially from those of the suburbs. Bastions of creativity.

But a lot of times it is a Banana Republic

Tired of the selfish old cunts who won’t let you out of your goddamned train because they think their time is so much more important than yours (fuck you, you fucking geriatric fucks). Tired of the absurd taxes that go straight into the pockets of corrupt machine politicians rather than to fix NYC’s third-world infrastructure. Tired of the self-important rent-a-cop twats who think they’re protecting you from another 9/11 (they aren’t). Tired of the dumb basic bitches who walk on the wrong side of the road but won’t move out of your way because they are Modern Independent Womyn. Tired of the 1% and their black-tie bleeding heart galas in the midst of real poverty and suffering by working Americans whose real wages haven’t gone up in decades.

Tired of the noise, the rats, the roaches, the fatties, and the deliberately slow walkers who take up way more of the sidewalk than necessary. Tired of being gawked at like some zoo exhibit by Eurotrash tourists who think that they can behave as badly as they want because they are somehow culturally superior to Americans (who fucking rebuilt their entire bombed-out continent after World War II). Tired of the hipster morons and their craft IPAs and armpit hair who have priced working people out of Brooklyn and Queens. Tired of Showtime!

Tired of the pretentious clowns who pretend like none of the above matters, that NYC is a great place to live, and that everywhere else is “uncultured” (even though other leading world cities kick the living shit out of this place on every conceivable quality of life measure imaginable). Tired of the NYC myopia and exceptionalism; there hasn’t been anything to brag about for 30+ years now.

Go fuck yourselves, all of you. I hope your fucking rat-infested, garbage-on-the-streets, overpriced, overrated piece of shit city gets hit by another Sandy and sinks to the bottom of the Atlantic where it fucking belongs.

>After the arrest of Raniere in March (which fits our timeline), certain celebs got spooked and wanted to start talking to try to get ahead of this thing – because Harvey wasn’t planning on talking then, himself (he still had AG Schneiderman in power as his protection). Sure, it’s probable that Bourdain did some horrible things – but if you can make your deeds pale in comparison to someone really evil, you might still make it out alive.

>Unless that really evil person catches wind of what you’re trying to do, and pulls a few strings, calls in a few last favors.

>Yeah, to me, this is looking more and more like Harvey (or someone above him) has ordered some kind of hit squad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Will we see more deaths? 

Will there be more fallout from Raniere/Weinstein?

49,Please: I need to know if I should call the police,328,iaskoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/iaskoi/please_i_need_to_know_if_i_should_call_the_police/,27,1597585516.0,"This is my first time posting to the boards. I’m here because I need help / advice. Of course neither of my brothers answers their fucking phones. I am completely terrified by what I have just witnessed. This happened ten minutes ago… my adrenaline is out of control… let me get it all out and stick to exactly what I remember. If anyone has any advice on what to do please PM ASAP!

My name is Adam and I live in Ocala, Florida. We’re in the center of the state and there’s not much going on here. I was recently furloughed from my job at a local media company on account of Covid and so I’ve been hanging at my apartment and applying to basically every job I can. Playing a lot of video games; trying not to go crazy. It’s been a weird year so far and I haven’t felt like myself.

Ten months ago, I signed a lease on this one-bedroom apartment in a nice gated community when I moved down to FL from NYC with my girl. The relationship didn’t last and now I’m here on my own trying to figure stuff out with a global pandemic making everything more stressful. Now this nutty shit happens today with my neighbors… and I need to know if I should call the police.

Not to get political, but we’ve had a huge disparity in responses to the pandemic, and so I’ve been grateful that my community has been super careful about wearing masks, distancing, etc. It’s a mixed family community but there are a fair amount of retirement-age folks and we are all conscious of that. I actually had Covid back in April but luckily was low grade symptoms.

This morning: I get a text from my neighbor, Jerry. I’ve met him and his wife Ethyl a handful of times. They are both older and live in the unit next to mine. Totally nice people. I think the guy made good money in real estate or something. The only thing is they have significant health issues. Ethyl is overweight and has cancer. They’ve been staying home since the lockdown, etc.

So you can imagine, I haven’t seen much of them for the past few months. And then I get this text from Jerry today saying that he has a very important package that has arrived from UPS but he is nervous to go to the mail room because of the surge and the fact that Ethyl is not doing great apparently. He asked me if I could go to the mail room and drop the package on his doorstep.

No big deal, right? I said sure. Happy to help. This was… I dunno… 20 minutes ago? I went to the mail room. Jerry had called in that I would be grabbing the package on his behalf. The guy at the concierge went to get it. He was grumbling about something, and when he handed the package to me, I understood why. I am not joking: the UPS box smelled like absolute shit.

I couldn’t believe it. We looked at each other; he made some comment, but at that point I was grossed out, said I needed to drop it off, and left. Thankfully our units were close by and I jogged over to Jerry and Ethyl’s apartment.  Trying not to think about the rancid smell. Not only the stench, but also the fact that the package had a *warmth* that I suddenly noticed.

Anyway, I got to their place, and went to drop it on the stoop. When I rang the doorbell, the most god awful pungent smell of rotting waste hit my nose. I realized it was coming from inside the house. The smell was so bad that it startled me. I felt sick and **immediately** became worried because if you had smelled this… it was just… it was hot, and wet, and, and INTENSE!

“Adam?” I heard Jerry on the other side of the door.

“Jerry?” He sounded… strange to me. “You guys alright?”

“Yes, sir. We’re both holding up okay. Thanks for helping out.”

I asked about the smell. He laughed and apologized. Said something about a rat dying in the walls of the house. I told him straight up it seemed worse than a dead rat and I was concerned. He laughed again and said this had happened before. Nothing to worry about. I asked about Ethyl. Jerry said she was okay and needed a lot of rest these days on account of her medical treatments.

At that point, I became aware of what I can only describe as a “humming” sound from behind the door. Not only did I feel like I could hear this humming sound, but when I came close to listen, I felt this inexplicable tingling on my face. It was very subtle. At first I thought I was sweating, but the humidity wasn’t bad, and I realized there was just, like, this *sensation* on my skin.

“**THAT’S NOT VERY NICE!”** Jerry screamed on the other side of the door.

His cry was so completely fucking unexpected that I stumbled backwards.

“Oh, sorry, Adam!” His voice was light again. “Was only kidding with you!”

At this point, I was so utterly unnerved that I decided to get the hell out of there. Just one of those bad feelings that you can’t ignore. Didn’t say anything to Jerry, just dropped off the stoop and turned to leave. Then – I don’t know what possessed me to do this. There was something about that humming noise that got in my head. So I quickly slunk around the side of their apartment.

I was consumed by the urge to see what was going on inside. If you heard that noise… you would have done the same. Now, the units in our community are pretty private; Jerry and Ethyl almost always have the blinds drawn. That not really strange on account of the heat in Ocala. So I decided to sneak around to their fenced in back yard where I was able to see through the kitchen window.

God. I wish I hadn’t looked. I… I don’t even know what to write. There were… people in the kitchen. I’ve never seen Jerry or Ethyl entertain guests, and I *know* for a fact they don’t have family in the area. And yet I saw at least eight or nine people. They were half-naked. I saw open boxes, like the one I had delivered, everywhere. These people were rubbing this… this *crap* all over the unit!

I cannot explain it any other way. I stood there for maybe 30 seconds staring at this scene in disbelief. These people were reaching into the boxes and smearing whatever the hell was inside all over their own bodies, all over the floor, the walls. That’s when I saw Ethyl. She was the only one completely naked. Ethyl was standing by the far wall, and SHE was the one who was humming.

This humming noise… I will never forget it. What freaked me out even more was that Ethyl… she looked so *different* than what I remembered!  She’d lost so much weight. It was unbelievable. Then, she looked up. Ethyl saw me through the window and *she started to cry*. The humming stopped, and the people in the kitchen stood very still. They turned to me - each person weeping.

I ran back here so fucking fast. I’m losing it and pretty much think I'm freaking out. Please: I need to know if anyone has any explanation of what just happened.  I’m wondering if it could be related to their medical issues, etc.?? I am okay to call the police if necessary; I just don’t know what to say. I may actually leave my place right now for a bit and go figure this out somewhere else.

Please help"
50,"Are there any theories out there on using natural predators to control rat populations in urban areas? For instance, releasing a single gender of owls/ferrets en mass in the NYC subway system until the problem subsides.  ",304,152bvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/152bvl/are_there_any_theories_out_there_on_using_natural/,189,1355857460.0,"EDIT: To clarify, ferrets and owls were just an example: not a required parameter for this hypothetical scenario. 

I understand the unknown potential consequences of introducing a predator species to a foreign habitat, which is why I stressed the single gender angle in the title. Neutered/sterile male/female would be acceptable as well of course - the goal being the predators can't reproduce and become another problem altogether.  

I should have stressed what I was really looking for: 

You're part of a scientific team tasked with looking at the possibility of using natural predators to thin out the rat population in NYC: given the logistical challenges, propose the best possible scenario that minimizes the unintended consequences of introducing natural predators to a foreign habitat in a densely populated urban area.

52,You want to mug me? Enjoy the wheel chair and permentant brain damage,300,bkh6kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackholerevenge/comments/bkh6kk/you_want_to_mug_me_enjoy_the_wheel_chair_and/,31,1556941678.0,"This was Dug up by me on removeddit as the original was deleted so this isn't my story so yeah don't blame me if this is fecced up so anyways here the story

Okay, to preface this entire fucked up story, this all took place 30 years ago. My memory is not that great, and I might get some things wrong. Also, I go into some graphic details, you have been warned. TL;DR at the end.

In 1989 I was a 19 year old kid living in NYC. I was working as a delivery guy at a dingy hole-in-the-wall pizza place in Hell's Kitchen that's long since gone out of business, and living paycheck to paycheck. I had moved to New York looking for work after my uncle's construction company went under, and had found a tiny shit hole of an apartment which was the only thing I could afford on the salary I got from the pizza place. The only reason I took the job was I needed money and it was extremely close to my apartment, only a short walk down a back alley (hint hint, the alley is important).

I want you all to keep in mind while reading this, the New York of 30 years ago was not the touristy New York of today. Murders were a lot more common, you would see hookers working the corner pretty often, Times Square was a cesspool of nudey-bars and porn theaters, gangs would rob people on the subway, and it was almost every day where I lived that you would see a druggie passed out in an alley or along the side of the road.

The whole ordeal started just after closing one night in July. The guy who owned the joint, Paulo, said that I could take some leftover pizza home with me that had been sitting under the heat lamp all day, but hey, at least it was free. I had been working at the pizza place for about a year by this point, and I was on really good terms with Paulo and his brother Joseph who both ran the joint. Paulo was easily pushing 300 pounds and had a habit of smoking a giant cigar while cooking. Joseph was always in the back handling the money side of things and taking phone orders. The restaurant had an exit into the alley which I would take to get back to my place. There would usually be a homeless vet named Alfonso that would sleep next to the hot air vent behind the place who would bum a smoke off me and we would shoot the shit for a few minutes after my shift. After talking with him I started to walk home, and after I had gotten quite a distance away down the alley I heard some bottles rustling behind a dumpster that was right ahead of me. My first thought was it was some rats, until this crazy-eyed dude swung out from behind it with a hunting knife in one hand and a metal bat in the other.

I remember this guy looked like your stereotypical druggie, track marks all over his arms, disgusting clothes on, wild dirty hair, and fidgeting like no tomorrow. He started yelling and half screaming at me to give him my wallet. At that point my adrenaline was through the roof as I had never been mugged before. I was carrying the pizza box with two hands, and when I shifted it to my left hand to reach into my back pocket for my wallet with my right, he started advancing on me. He started muttering to himself asking why I was doing that and sort of grunting while jabbing at the air in front of him. At this point I know this guy is high off his ass on something or a definite head case.

He was really close to me by this point, and before I could take my wallet out he loaded up his right arm and slashed me across my face with the hunting knife just below my left eye. At first it didn't really hit me, and I was stunned for a second. It was at that point I started thinking, ""this is it, I'm gonna die in a fucking alley over the 4 bucks I have in my wallet"". That's when I decided to start fighting, if I was going down, I was doing it swinging.

I threw the pizza box in his face which made him step back a little bit, and using both hands I grabbed the bat out of his left hand that he was still holding. I flipped it around, and aimed for the outside of his left knee which was the one closest to me. It connected and I heard a snap when it buckled inwards. This brought him to one knee, but he started to get back up again like he couldn't even feel it. I swung as hard as I could and hit the left side of his temple which made a crunch sound before he crumpled to the concrete.

I remember being so incredibly scared, absolutely terrified. I don't remember much after this. Years after this happened when I went to see a psychiatrist for other reasons and this was brought up, and she told me it is likely because my mind was trying to shield me from the trauma of the whole experience. The next thing I remember is being soaked in blood and standing above this guy. I knew he was still alive, as he was gurgling blood out of his mouth and his chest was still rising and falling. There was blood coming out of his ears, nose, and mouth. His right hand and arm that had been holding the knife was a mangled mess with fingers jutting out every which way while the knife was a good 4 feet away on the ground.

I dropped the bat and half stumbled, half walked back to the pizza place. Alfonso had heard the screaming and come to look. He told me that I had a glazed over look to me and I was almost entirely soaked in blood. He led me back to the pizza joint where Paulo started called the cops and an ambulance and Paulo's brother, Joseph, rushed out of the back and grabbed a bottle of cheap Prosecco we had from below the counter to douse my cut with while stemming the bleeding with table napkins.

I spent the night in the hospital because apparently I was disorientated and so confused I didn't know where I was because of blood loss. The next day I was doing better, and there were two cops that came to take my statement. After I had told my side of the story the older looking of the two cops said that after 10 years on the job that guy took the worst beating he'd seen anyone take and survive. The younger looking one started telling me what I had done to the guy which included: severed knee ligaments, broken and dislocated fingers, broken ribs which had punctured a lung, a broken femur, multiple crushed and pulverized bones, a severed spinal cord with a couple broken vertebrae, a burst ear drum, multiple teeth knocked out, completely fractured jaw, a broken nose, a burst eye, a destroyed eye socket, and a completely destroyed cheek bone. He also told me that I had hit his skull so hard there was spinal fluid leaking out of his ears.

They said that they had spoken to Alfonso, Paulo and Joseph, and they corroborated my story that the bat was the junkie's and I had most likely acted in self defense. Although I had no answer to their question of why didn't I stop after he went down besides ""I don't know"" and ""I don't remember"". After a couple days I was discharged and after just a little while I was back to working at the pizza place. Although I now had a massive scar running down the side of my face and Paulo jokingly called me scarface all the time. Even now I jokingly say to my wife before sexy time ""say hello to my little friend"" which we still giggle maniacally about together. I was also super jumpy right after the fact whenever I heard bottles clanging together, which unfortunately happened a lot because Joseph used to take the empty coke bottles to the recycling plant at the end of every week.

What made me tell this story here is that recently I thought about how much of the junkie's blood might have gotten in my mouth or in the slash across my face. At the time it happened the whole HIV/AIDS panic was in full swing, and the guy being a junkie instantly made me realize how much shit I could be in. If I was infected without knowing it I could have passed it onto my wife or even my children by accident. After quite the panic between me and my wife because of overlooking this we got the blood results back just a bit ago and thankfully I'm completely clean. My doctor said that if I was infected back then symptoms would have likely manifested by now as well.

So there, that is my incredibly long winded story about one of the scariest events in my life, and the resurgent panic it brought up just a bit ago. I would be happy to answer any questions you have about it, but I'm taking a flight for work in a bit so you probably won't get a response from me for a few hours.

TL;DR: Used to work at a dingy pizza place, was slashed across the face by a mugger, beat him half to death, got a cool scar, and 30 years after the fact had a panic that I might have gotten HIV."

Deceased was found with multiple stab wounds to the abdomen. There was a small aperture in the subject’s right ankle. Things of note: the right foot was missing a large amount of cartilage, the victim suffered a severe head trauma (suspected to have slipped in the tub), and the large intestine was vaporised by chemical means. Prints on the weapon, and a sweep through the apartment reveal cause of death to be most likely suicide, however, requires further investigation.

RECORDING FROM PRIVATE DETECTIVE JOHN H MADISON
May 27 2017 
 
That last document is the most suspicious of all of them. Why is it so brief? What are they trying to hide? 
 
Who I am is not important. I’ll let you in on what I do. I uncover old case files. Missing persons, homicides, you name it. This line of work is grueling, down right frustrating if you ask me on a good day. But recently I’ve come to find some extraordinary evidence linking multiple cases together. This term being floated around, “bathtub suicides”, well I’m starting to think they’re not just suicides. Someone is trying to cover this up. 
 
Neighborhoods are losing their water supply. Black SUV’s drive up and down my suburban village. Men in pricy suits with shades for eyes are knocking on doors and telling people to not inspect their pipes. People are getting evicted without notice. The Department of Water Works has let something loose in the pipes. Something they can’t control. 
 
There’s always a similar pattern. The victims try to cut something out of them. Something invaded their bodies while they blissfully showered away or sipped at their glass of wine in the tub. After being poisoned by something in the water they desperately try to claw it out. All witnesses claim the victims involved were screaming of ants under the skin or giant tapeworms inching their way up their gut. 
 
No one is reporting on this. The news channels are all turning a blind eye. Those that have been questioning suddenly going missing. Wiped off the face of the Earth. The government is well aware, and I’m sure they’re spying. Keeping tabs on their little fuck up. Well I’m going to expose this. If they keep trying to contain the situation like they’ve been doing, more people are going to die. 
 
What I’m aware of is that the thing that kills you is the faucet. Don’t wash your hands. Don’t take a bath. Don’t shower. Don’t clean your dishes. It lives in the pipes. So far I’ve seen cases stretching from Texas to NYC. No one is safe while there is so little coverage of the event. 
 
Victims are tallying up. How long can they call these suicides for? The thing in that diary (static) How he described it (static) I can’t.

DIARY OF JUAN GONZALEZ

ENGLISH TRANSLATION
 
I am finally out of surgery and able to remember. No one will listen, they all refuse, but I remember still. 
 
I was in the bathtub washing myself when I noticed black water leaking from the faucet. I quickly turned off the faucet, but the black water kept coming. It would not stop. Then the black snake dropped from the open faucet. It was something like a black snake. It had black bumps all around its body. It coiled around my left foot before I was able to get out of the tub. I tried screaming for my daughters in the other room, but the moment was so soon. I was back in the tub with the black snakes and the dark water. 
 
Then it bit into my knee. I tried grabbing it but it worked its way inside of my knee. I wanted to remain calm, but I could no longer deny what was happening. That’s when I screamed for my daughters. I yelled and gasped for air. The snake moved its way inside me. I watched it crawl up my skin into my stomach. There was this horrible sucking sound, like a plane engine. The bone in my leg snapped and my stomach felt full. 
 
The parasite sat in my stomach. I woke up in the hospital sometime later. They wouldn’t let me see my daughters. Men in yellow suits with bright green gloves locked me in the room. They said I would see them soon. I don’t know if I’ll lose the leg. The men in yellow say I’ll be fine, but I don’t trust them. I don’t even trust that this is a hospital. I can feel bumps inside of me. And my nose is constantly running. 
 
I will see my daughters again. I swear it.

54,31 year old with end stage kidney disease,293,ijqfka,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/ijqfka/31_year_old_with_end_stage_kidney_disease/,90,1598843535.0,"Hi everyone,

I never posted here but I wanted to share or have some sort of output:

I always knew I had kidney disease since I graduated from college, but my kidney got a lot worst over the years, especially when I move to California with my bf, which is ex now (I’ll discuss it more later). When I first found out my kidney got a lot worst. I broke down every night, i tried so hard to be strong and stay optimistic, but i got weaker and weaker....

I ended up enrolling into a kidney transplant team in California, but they told me to list three support system, but sadly I can only put one person down... I knew I couldn’t stay in California anymore because I don’t have a strong support system, especially my families are from across the United States, Jersey. 

I have decided to end my relationship with my partner because I knew it would be a crazy mess if he stayed with me, and I never ever wanted to alter someone’s life for me, also he told me he would not want to move back to jersey with me because his life is in cali... I was heartbroken because he is an amazing person.

Once I got to my hometown, my NYC doctor got a bunch of bloodwork done and told me I need dialysis ASAP.... so I did my surgery on the upper neck region for dialysis ( this is a temporary port because it’s too close to the heart and the actual one is on the arm). I was a bit sad at first because I can no longer take a shower because there is a opening on my upper chest near by the neck, so I need to wipe myself and sometimes my parents will help me since I can’t reach my back. 

I also try getting on the transplant list for a hospital but I found out that I have blood issue, so I have been in varies medication to help with that. So far I am like a  lab rat trying so many medication. My hair thin so bad because one medication was very strong....

Overall, I feel very frustrated and disappointed because this was suppose to be my prime year for work and for my life but everything went to a stopping point. I am extremely grateful for my family and friends, but there are times I feel exhausted and stressed thru medical treatment, medicine and a lot of medical bills (I’m slowly going broke lol...). I ended up seeking a therapist because I was going crazy and trust me I was!

There is a lot of info I am missing in between the story and I do apologize because there are sooo much info but last month I just did surgery on my arm for another port for dialysis. I was hospitalized for 9 days due to some blood issues. Now I am slowly recovering and trying new medication for my blood platelets issues.

I’m sorry that I basically rambled my crazy mess, and it probably doesn’t make any sense... I just wanted someone to read my story I guess... 

Regards,"

56,Canada is over-hyped by Canadians way too much.,288,e13c8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/e13c8g/canada_is_overhyped_by_canadians_way_too_much/,163,1574624148.0,"I'm Canadian. Lived in Canada all my life (but most of my family lives in the US) and i know there are a lot of stuff i take for granted (safety, security). But if the definition of over-hyped had a country beside it, it would be Canada.

We as Canadians love to hype our country to feel better and we love to look down on those god-awful Americans who are so beneath us. We use American websites (Youtube/Google/Reddit), and American technologies (ie. Apple, the GPS, *now*...Tesla) to watch \[predominantly\] American films as we look down on those pesky backward Americans that are so beneath us.

**Example**: ""bIg cORpoRatIonS rUn tHE UsA"" -- umm, perhaps you need to look at the big 3 telecom companies in Canada. That isn't an ""American"" issue.

Now, you're probably wondering as to **why** i think Canada is ""over-hyped""...

* Firstly, our whole identity is based on ""*NOT*"" being American. We don't know what and who we are. We can say we're the ""Most multicultural country ever"", but that is meaningless when you look at every big American city. Look me in the face and tell me NYC, LA, Miami don't have multiple cultures in among themselves.
* Climate wise, where do i start? It's cold and cloudy for 7-8 months so if you like warm weather and sunshine, good luck! At least in the US, you literally have every climate/geography of your choice. Canada really is a frozen wasteland (though beautiful, but pointlessly so...) for the most part.
   * 50% of the country lives between Windsor and Montreal despite being the second largest country on earth. That's right, [50% of Canada lives in an area that is smaller than the entire state of California.](https://brilliantmaps.com/half-canada/)
* Cost of living is outrageous in the 3 big cities we have. On the other hand the US has 30-40+ cities to choose from with over 1 million people (i am counting metro populations)...meaning way more job opportunities. And, if you can't afford NYC, you could always move to Dallas or Houston. In Canada, if you can't afford Toronto, you can move to frozen Winnipeg (which is still more expensive than Houston/Dallas)  but good luck if you're a skilled worker.
* Pay is terrible for skilled professionals (Canada has a brain drain to the USA)
* The biggest city in Canada (Toronto) does not scream world class by most people outside Canada. I know as Canadians, we talk about how amazing Toronto is compared to any other city in North America...but by what standards? If you constantly have to remind yourself how ""Toronto is the best""...that says a lot. It all plays back into the idea of Canadians over-hyping Canada. If you have to remind yourself how amazing your are everyday compared to the US, you're clearly envying something from the US. In all honesty, Toronto is as interesting as Houston is to Americans. It's got cool stuff like in every other big city, but nothing that ""wows"" you like NYC or Chicago.
   * [Skilled workers (ex. Tech) make more in the Midwest US than they do in some of the most expensive cities in NA.](https://external-preview.redd.it/43UPYvrcs1gDlDlEcTJyvArcPLo-ghaJF4fik715H9k.jpg?auto=webp&s=c943655484fb9543cf4758f0665f11155a73d695)
   * Architecturally speaking, [Toronto](https://images.thestar.com/wNbuYG7FLJKPrItPoEsxJx5mZ3M=/1086x724/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/star-columnists/2019/01/07/how-condo-towers-are-redrawing-the-toronto-skyline/_1_skyline.jpg) lacks a persona. [Vancouver](https://www.deepcovekayak.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Vancouver-skyline-1.jpg) is even worse. It's just a bunch of glass condos stacked by each other. I do give credit to Montreal/Quebec City for having some aesthetics though...but they also happen to be French.
   * Homicide rate wise, Toronto is pretty good, i admit, but Austin, Boston, Portland, San Diego County are even better than the GTA in per-capita terms. Even the most dangerous American cities (ie. Detroit, Chicago) are safe outside a few run down blocks where it is primarily gang activity.
* The **Healthcare** quality in Canada is a **joke**. Looking down on the American system is the most Canadian thing ever, but you'd be stupid to think the quality of care in the US is somehow worse than sitting in a shitty strip mall plaza at a clinic for 2+ hours waiting for your scheduled ""appointment"" only to be met by a doctor who is focused on rushing just to get to the next patient. Never mind a walk-in-clinic. In the US, if you don't have insurance and are in the bottom 20%, you might go bankrupt *after* receiving the care. In Canada, you die like [this person](https://globalnews.ca/news/5082756/woman-dies-new-brunswick-emergency-room/) or [this person](https://globalnews.ca/news/5821795/ns-death-hospital-transfer/) OR [this person](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/st-boniface-emergency-room-patient-dies-1.5179640) from **not** receiving the care.

If i could write a 10-paged essay right now, i would. There is a sort of anti-intellectualism that exists in Canada where anything associated with the US = bad. It would be nice if we looked in the mirror for once and didn't have to compare ourselves to a nation 10 times our size to feel ""better"". Canadians minimize their issues and maximize American issues to feel better (ie: violence, poverty, racism). It comes off as hypocritical and insecure, to say the least.

I'm glad Canada has been my home for so long, but I cannot wait to find a job (i'm in tech) in the US and get the hell out of here. Listening to Canadians bitch and whine about how inferior the Americans are is by far our worst quality.

**TLDR**; Canada is overhyped in many ways. The healthcare is not as great as made out to be, cost of living and the climate sucks!

EDIT: Fixed Canada is the largest country on earth and changed it to second."

**Background** by /u/GhostofRimbaud

Patrick “Wiki” Morales is a voracious, exuberant Irish-Puerto Rican rapper from New York City, spitting truths and rude musings through a broken tooth for the better part of the past decade. Pat is an avowed rap purist that puts his heart in the art, claiming he does it simply because “[I love to do this shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXB1G_IWMjY).” As a prodigy in the NYC art scene, Wiki was given his sobriquet through a duo with a kid named Googs (after Google and Wikipedia) and eventually started [putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnviAWU8QwY) [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uPR50Akm7M) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU-nvaMQBDA) & [raps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXp9CBHR4XM&list=RDmnviAWU8QwY&index=7). Later, he saw success with the [Wikispeaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9QdEfruq_0) video and the critically acclaimed albums *WIKI93* and *So It Goes* from gritty, city kid triumvirate Ratking. He's also known for a popular verse on Earl Sweatshirt’s [AM//Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiwHmHdd4Xg), and a series of recent solo projects and collaborative EP’s.

Through [live performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqHo8XsfoBU) and recorded songs, Wiki has proven himself a [capable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeuHFRKkhf8) [freestyler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RFFvrGmGAs) and [songwriter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFEg3fk3CgU) with a punk sensibility, known to [smack himself in the face](https://youtu.be/Sdn3__jAH64?t=676) with mics at live shows when “losin’ hype!” He’s one of the stalwarts of good, grimy, do-it-yourself NYC boom bap, holding on resolutely in the face of NYC radio’s commercial landscape. Wiki’s a part of the same underground-adjacent NYC scene as Your Old Droog, Tony Seltzer, Princess Nokia, sLuMs, and others. He's even a newly independent artist, having parted ways with XL Recordings before the release of this album, [after his original A&R left the label](https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/wiki-oofie-ratking-patrick-morales-drinking-new-york-city-xl-skepta-2583626).

Wiki has a history of multimedia output beyond music, having sold indie zines filled with drawings, the [ubiquitous wiki tag](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS778US778&biw=1440&bih=691&tbm=isch&sxsrf=ACYBGNQ7frBo2YDhNafpEkhZXceHUKyGbQ%3A1578899275846&sa=1&ei=SxccXrylM43RtAaN-rDACw&q=wiki+patrick+morales+tag&oq=wiki+patrick+morales+tag&gs_l=img.3...4425.8236..8328...0.0..0.142.2646.4j20......0....1..gws-wiz-img.......35i39j0i8i30j0j0i67j0i131j0i10j0i30j0i24.EYcCUgTSrts&ved=0ahUKEwj89uOTgoDnAhWNKM0KHQ09DLgQ4dUDCAc&uact=5#imgrc=HpV8car2I7PqoM:), original lyric notes, and photo collage.

His involvement on *OOFIE* is no different, as Wiki previewed the whole album on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wikset/?hl=en), each song with an adjoining drawing, as well as an album cover illustrated by the Leppy Coqui himself.

His last album *No Mountains in Manhattan,* named after dialogue in Scorsese’s 1973 *Mean Streets,* is a study of Wiki’s external world in NYC. It’s a personification of the Rotten Apple in all its grime and glitter,  a love letter to the concrete jungles, Chinatown dumpling spots, screeching subway cars, and summertime parks of New York City. NMIM boasts a vivid, visual acuity echoing Walt Whitman’s own exuberant lyrical celebration of [Mannahatta](https://poets.org/poem/mannahatta). It represented an outward look at Wiki's electric city, while *OOFIE* flips the lens, magnifying the internal workings of the NY emcee.

**Review** by /u/GhostofRimbaud

*OOFIE* shows Wiki exploring his emotional world, relationships, and personal history with disarming honesty and vulnerability. It's an album of catharsis and rap therapy, showing the reality behind being an underground success. The album’s temporal scope is broad, as he reflects on his past, present, and where he may be headed. He examines his age and place in hip hop, as well as his own experiences with addiction and depression. No stranger to self-deprecation, Wiki uses brutal introspection to probe and expose his darker thoughts and feelings about himself. He turns these insecurities into a kind of kindling for a phoenix rise, morphing his troubles and successes into one victory cry, determined to persevere despite the stresses of trying to pay NYC rent off underground rap records.

**1.** **Tenacity in the Face of Defeat**

After a fitting sample (“he wears the same shit every fucking day, breath stinks”), Wik begins ""Intro"" spitting in a labored cadence, addressing his haters, spurned friends, and critics: “Tell me shave my uni-brow, I'd rather shave my balls/Nah, fuckers always talkin', never takin' charge/I wanted this shit since like seventh grade, and that's on God/You couldn't do it then so ratin' me became your job.” From the onset of the project, Wiki emphasizes originality and artistic action, painting himself as someone who took the plunge and was talented enough to come out the other side of rap alive. Still, he acknowledges the characteristics that make him strange to some, while imparting humor and a willingness to forgo his ego.

In the following song “Downfall”, he ponders the risk in dedicating his life to art, “Y'all ain't seen my downfall yet/Down with a motherfucker til he down on his ends/Til he down on his luck/Travel town to town for the bucks/I made pounds with the pen/Hit the ground and just went.” It’s commentary on contemporary culture, where people pile onto a person’s faults at the slightest provocation. Still, this is one of many surprisingly triumphant songs on the album, where Wiki confides his troubles in the listener, while maintaining the personal tenacity and effervescent spirit that’s gotten him this far.

The lead single “Pesto” (featuring an all-green music video) is one of the main bangers on the album, with a stuttering Tony Seltzer beat of rolling hi hats, punching kicks and a hypnotic, warped xylophone-esque loop exuding an off-kilter urgency. It's discombobulated yet on-point, like a charismatic drunk.

Wiki vacillates between the personal and flex shit, sometimes between songs and sometimes within songs, making sure there’s something for everyone even if you’re uninterested in his inner life. The energy behind ""Pesto"" is irrefutable, and works to balance the slower, darker cuts. Wiki still keeps the theme consistent with lyrics like ""Reviews strong, but not enough views on the song"", voicing a frustration with being a critically acclaimed artist that doesn't see many record sales from his output.

“Grim”, with hard as marble verses from Lil Ugly Mane and Denzel Curry, continues the momentum, featuring a pitched-up piano loop, with skittering drums and washed-out, rusted music-box effects between verses. The song feels like a Secret Circle song, substituting Denzel in place of accused rapist Antwon.

The banger songs on this album, including 4 Clove Club, show confidence and perseverance in spite of the nihilism and superficiality of the music industry. This is Wiki’s most cynical album yet, but if you listen between the lines, you see a visceral, dogged resolve to keep pushing despite all the bullshit that life, and himself, may throw at him. There’s prevalent themes of self-sabotage throughout the record as Wiki wrestles with the hopes, doubts, and pressures of his path.

**2**. **Melancholy Nostalgia**

Wiki continues to rap with sporadic, wandering flows, riding hype beats expertly, while using a slower, pained cadence for the others. He’s always wielded surprise like a sword, capitalizing on an unpredictable, singular voice no matter the beat. Personal songs, like “The Act”, show the vulnerability below the surface, with Wiki on the verge of tears and emotional breakdown at certain points, his voice cracking, wailing, and briefly falling off beat.

“Way That I Am” returns to that former determination. The song has a simple kick, rapid snare pattern over a loop singing “what makes you do?”, with a Your Old Droog verse \[REDACTED\]. The soaring soul sample mirrors the triumphant lyrics, seeming to ask the listener “what makes you do what you do?” The chorus testifies to Wiki’s vehement individuality, as he claims, “It's just the way that I am/It's how I live, I do what I do/The way they are pisses me off/The way they talk, the shit that they spew.”

Later, Wiki asks the listener to “pardon me, don’t be startled by the honesty/don’t start with me the blood that runs in my arteries.” On this album, Wiki plumbs new depth picking apart his life and self in the context of his art, wondering if he’ll be “successful or just the one with the most potential.” He finds freedom in creative expression while cognizant of the anxieties, battles, and pitfalls of a musician’s life. This album is a murky diary, showing listeners every angle of Wiki’s daily emotional experience.

“Back Then” is the most blatantly nostalgic of these songs, depicting Wiki as a mentor to the kids running in the streets, a pack he was once part of. But he also reminisces on his own youth, using the song as a document of ""times back then"" when ""you was always late to your classes/had to wake up at 6 just to make it to the motherfucking train and catch it/you was Uptown, school was in Brooklyn/explain why you missed that shit, don't mean to be so nostalgic but oof.""

The song is a good summation of the project, imparting a ""hindsight is 2020"" feeling. Wiki half-admonishes his younger self, while looking back with equal parts fondness and anxiety, worrying the best years have passed him, ""I was on one when I was so young, I was so dumb/everything in front of me now it seems like everything's done."" The back half of the first verse catalogues the changes in his city, where his memories are the only things remaining of ""the spots we grew up and grew close to.""

“The Routine” follows that concept with more levity, as Wiki accepts the changes that come with age while imparting wisdom to the next generation of juvenile delinquents, starting on fun, swaggering lines “Bitch don't cool-guy me/I'm too high for that bullshit talk, I'ma walk, I'm gone/Shit, you need a new ID/I see it in your eyes like visine like I'm your motherfuckin' mom.” The dynamics of his adolescence have switched, with Wiki playing the part of his own parent, admonishing and sonning mischievous kids that just don't know better.

“Dame Aqui” (trans: give it here) is yet another collaboration from Wiki and his ex-girlfriend Princess Nokia. This is the most fun, light-hearted song on the project, with the lyrics and production conjuring far-off beaches and Caribbean grooves. Wiki recounts a funny, drunken memory of sleeping in Stockholm jail because he ""punched the window in the Euro club when they played DMX."" Sometimes energy gotta come out.

Despite the levity, Nokia echoes the main themes of the album, “Been around the world and I'm two times back/Three passports and a few new stamps/I miss MTA bus pass/Ever since I got famous I been stuck in a cab/Traveling is sure not easy, I love that fettuccine”, showing the road's rigors may not be easy, but how else is a starving artist supposed to make money and eat some fettuccine? It's another good example of the ""between a rock and a hard place"" mentality of the album.

**3. Stepping Back from Rock Bottom**

The penultimate “Promises” holds some of Wiki’s most poignant writing of his career, over a bright, drifting beat comprised of a string loop and soft drums, with a lilting chorus courtesy of duendita. Wik weaves together autobiographical lines about his family history, picking through his past to make sense of the present. Most of all, he opens up about his drinking problem, something that [caused him ulcers near the release of Lil Me.](https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/exploring-new-yorks-best-cheap-eats-with-wiki/)

This song explores the cyclical trappings of substance abuse, where Wiki needs weed just to eat, then pukes because he doesn’t eat enough to offset the alcohol in his stomach (even though drinking on an empty stomach will give him more bang for his buck in terms of getting fucked up, relatable lol). This song is Wiki completely transparent, lamenting that he needs to get his shit together or else end up a fucked up, red-faced bum on the block:

“Tryna find my peace, keep my mind at ease/I'ma beg and plead, when will the cycle cease?/I need weed to smoke so I can eat/Just so I can drink, what's wrong with me?/What I need, brew to think honestly/Next day I'm puking up, obviously/'Cause I ain't ate enough and drank too much/Start again, now I need weed to puff/You see I'm stuck, am I changing enough?/I don't wanna be the neighborhood drunk.”

Throughout *OOFIE*, Wiki shows alcohol to be a coping mechanism for anxiety, agoraphobia, and depression, like “The Routine”: “When you around me, shit, you are not on/Everyone walk around like they the one/I don't wanna walk around unless I'm drunk/Is he the talk of the town or he just a punk?” He paints himself as someone who sometimes struggles to leave their house sober, despite making a living rapping in front of crowds.

Melodically, Wiki adapts his flows and lyrics masterfully to the instrumentation of the album, like when he shifts his inflection to fit the feel of the beat change at the start of the “Rugrat turned club rat” verse in “The Routine”. So much of this album is concerned with lost youth and innocence, with knowing when the party's over, and learning how to pick up the pieces of a past life without cutting yourself on the broken glass.

The last song “Freaks” features strangled horn hits, meandering bass, and jazzy piano lines, as Wiki claims he “did it for the freaks.” Though he feels an outsider at times, he doesn’t try to change in any disingenuous way. He’s learned to love his authentic self, showing this album to be a work of self-acceptance, like a compromise between past and present. At the end of the day, he’s secure knowing there will always be freaks like him that appreciate what he’s doing creatively, and those are the kids he does it for, because he knows what it’s like to be them.

**4. Uptown Train**

Wiki does lots of looking back on this record, but with an eye on the road ahead and self-improvement in the present. There’s a cathartic light at the end of the subway tunnel despite the darkness of creeping cynicism. He paints a picture of gratitude, perseverance, and yearning. Wiki’s not just a loudmouth NY kid with bars, and *OOFIE* shows his range as an artist able to access a deeper side without seeming saccharine or forced. Though he’s only 26, he's earned his spot as a battered veteran of the rap world, the perennial underdog, underrated and under-appreciated. He wants his flowers while he’s here, and who can blame him?

Despite his personal and professional battles, things are looking good for everyone’s favorite Celtic-Boricua MC. With a recent song [“Eggs”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3czsW6vHYU) produced by Madlib, and rumors of a food-themed project on the way, Wiki is an artist you can always count on for authenticity and originality. Patrick Morales is one of the most compelling, believable, and hard-working voices in hip-hop today, so grab a Ballentine and throw *OOFIE* on, just don’t end up the neighborhood drunk. *Yerrrrp!*

Score: 8/10

I wasn’t enjoying myself, kept telling myself “no pain no gain”, “it’s do or die”, and all that bull crap. Then I realized what the hell am I doing...? I’m out here to get away from the stress and hardship of everyday life, especially living in nyc. We are so conditioned to be stressed about things and worry in our every day lives that we take it with us even when we’re out here and are meant to enjoy ourselves. I’ve met so many people that treat the AT like a job because that’s what they are conditioned to do. If you are not enjoying yourself why are you out here... take some zeros, explore the awesome towns around the AT. Have fun. Meditate, relax, let go of worries. Of course there are people that love the challenge of 40 mile days and that’s their relaxation and that’s awesome for them, but if that’s not you, don’t stress yourself out. You’re out here because you’re on an adventure you want to remember for a life time, not to be apart of the “hikers rat race”. I’m so conditioned to be in the rat race in New York City and it’s hard to escape those patterns of behavior and thinking. It’s hard work training yourself to relax, take it all in, and jus enjoy yourself. You should be proud of yourself if you achieve that. Don’t beat yourself up and stress out. Hike your own hike, love the trail and it’s people, and work on taking life on slowly."

&#x200B;

Someone, a few months ago, made their ""top 3 nyc schools review."" In an effort to provide more color and a difference of opinion, I will be doing my own.

&#x200B;

**~~Marcelo Garcia (~~*****~~The GOAT~~*****~~):~~**

* ***~~Facility / Location~~***~~: I arrived early by an hour. By the the time class started, close to 50-60 people were ready to take the all-level's gi class. Mat space is ample, but slightly more crowded than what I feel comfortable with. It's NYC I remind myself, and if you're not interested in someone rubbing shoulders with you, then it's the wrong place to live, yet alone train. And yet, I couldn't get over the locker-room situation.  Packed together like sardines in a jar, everyone's ball-sack is 2-inches away from you. Putting on your clothing is frantic and I try to not trip over anyone's bags, feet, or bent over torso. Sure these are going to be your brothers, but no, simply no.~~
* ***~~Instruction~~***~~:  Paul Schreiner, the scientist, steps onto the mat to begin his lecture. We warmed up with some arm bars and triangles. He transitions it into a collar+sleeve guard triangle follow by a matrix attack when your opponent postures and shrugs you off. His name does live up to the hype.~~    ***~~Next class:~~*** ~~Marcelo, in classic fashion, taught a series of grip fighting details. Everyone is laser focused now.  Lutes and Tinoco seemed to always offer their assistance to everyone who had questions and Marcelo's personality reflects in his students.~~
* ***~~Cost~~***~~: I can't remember the exact pricing but it was around 220-260$ a month.~~
* ***~~Schedule~~***~~: Well put together, a dual focus on gi and no-gi jiu jitsu. It's upside is my downside, an avid gi only practitioner.~~
* ***~~Misc~~***~~: MG apparel is really sleek. And by the love of god, the best competitor in 2000's era is there smiling away like he didn't maul grown men in his prime.~~

**~~Renzo Gracie HQ:~~**

* ***~~Facility / Location~~***~~:  The locker room is the opposite of Marcelo's, gaping in size and with proper showers and lockers. In terms of sheer mat-space, this is the goliath of jiu jitsu gyms. 1 floor muay thai; 1 floor for pro-MMA fighters with a cage; and 1 floor with 2 massive blue rooms -- yes those famous mats -- which, if you follow jiu jitsu, you know how many people have made a career here. Simply put, when you walk into Renzo's, there's an atmospheric shift,  perpetuated by  the legendary Gracie name and its history.~~
* ***~~Instruction~~***~~: I was there for a beginner class 2 years ago. I never felt so coddled. They may as well have shown me how to tie my shoe-laces. Heavy emphasis on the basics. Yes, I know, it's called the beginners class, and while I cannot contest that, imagine spending an entire year or perhaps 2 learning BJJ movements and doing very tame specific rounds. So I left and went to academy that allowed me to experiment.~~ ***~~Next class:~~***  ~~A week ago, I came back for an advanced gi class. Excited. And yet again, disappointed. One instructor walked around to look at 40 people's technique and most people were doing a simple half guard pass wrong. If you look across the board, RGHQ doesn't really have any high-level GI guys, and, well, with my limited knowledge, it makes complete sense.~~
* ***~~Cost~~***~~: Somewhere around 210-250 a month, on a month-to-month basis for only jiu jitsu. The M-t-M was definitely a pro. I think you could also have access to RGBKY & RGUpperWest. And this really opens you up to the plethora of affiliates across the tri-state --- that's massive upside as affiliates will most likely waive drop-ins if you frequent seldom.~~
* ***~~Schedule~~***~~:  Similar to Marcelo with a nice split.~~
* ***~~Misc~~***~~: I didn't hear any music being played, which is something I thoroughly enjoy when I roll.  Also unless you prove yourself, you will never get an iota of acknowledgement from Johnny D, whose known to give people sharp looks if they roll in his selected mat-space. Fair enough, but... if you're paying for improvement and fair treatment, this isn't a democracy, it's a boy's club for the Gracie + Johnny D students / loyalist.~~

**~~Unity~~**

* ***~~Facility / Location~~***~~: The village is a great neighborhood and definitely less bustling than midtown vibes of MG & RG. Compared to the old unity -- which I dropped in to a year ago -- the new unity is like the first bite of fruit on a hot summer's day. Sweet. It's mat space is massive, competing well with MG. Locker room is packed but you're not sack-to-sack to anyone.~~
* ***~~Instruction~~***~~:  Someone said ""Culture eats strategy for breakfast,"" and well in this case, you're breakfast and unity is culture eating you. However, once you're in unity, you become part of that culture instantaneously. Murillo commands the class like a drill sergeant with his navy seals Miyaos', Bones, Levi, Felipe, Junny, among others, ready to both put in the work and help. It's bushido. And I must repeat, Murillo's attention to details is bar none, he's like a hawk watching your every move.~~
* ***~~Cost~~***~~: They are super shy about pricing. So out of respect, I won't say their prices. But expect 200+ depending on how your contract and commitments are set up. I think it's the most pricey out of the three if you're looking at averages / aggregates across NYC.  It is a nail-biter for sure. And for poor NYCers, this is analogous to chopping your limb off everytime you see a rat in subway.~~
* ***~~Schedule~~***~~: Bigger emphasis on gi training, with much longer class times. Sorry no gi guys, but I like my ankles. Also, ""you mean i don't have to waste time doing stupid forward rolls again because each class ends in 1 hour.""~~
* ***~~Misc~~***~~: Gear is nice. And i'm still very star struck by the miyaos. Great for smaller people like myself. So ladies of BJJ... Tex Johnson isn't here anymore, come through.~~

~~TLDR:~~

**~~Conclusion~~**~~: They are all great schools depending on your goals.~~

* ~~Renzos is the best if you're a JJ --> MMA route or super interested in sub-no gi. If you like the gi, imo, run far away. Unless you like to do this for 'fun' -- whatever that means -- I'm here for the CTE and arthritis by 40.~~
* ~~MG is focused on both no-gi and gi. It's got a lot of world-class people there but also a ton of hobbyist. Please fix the locker room. (Possible expansion in the works?)~~
* ~~Unity is like purposefully locking yourself into as special hell-hole. Collegial is the best way to describe it, academic, competitive, and well run.~~"

It’s a quick theory: Joker received his scars by squealing.

We all know the line: I know a squealer when I see ‘em. 

What he saw on the screen was his old self before he became the Joker.

My evidence doesn’t come from the film or canon, but from the memoir “A Drinking Life” by Pete Hamill.

This passage is from when he was about 10 in NYC in the early 1950s:

“I heard of police informers who disappeared in the night and others who were slashed with a knife, from the corner of the mouth to the upper point of the cheek, the mouth gashed into a grotesque elongation like the face of a grinning man at Steeplechase Park in Coney Island: the awful Mark of the Squealer.”

So I contend Joker used to be a rat with no morals or code of conduct. Once he was outed as a squealer and deformed, he turned on the world and its stupid codes. Anarchy, he decided, was the true path."
65,What Having 4 First Rounders Really Means,235,a1anhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/a1anhv/what_having_4_first_rounders_really_means/,92,1543441012.0,"The Celtics need to make a move. 

And, this has nothing to do with our current position. It has to do with this: **We likely have 4 first round picks this offseason (Kings, Grizz, Clips, Our Own)**.

The result is the Celtics of course having great assets, but given our needs and roster make-up, it puts us in sort of an uneviable catbird seat for this season through the 19' draft.

Along with discussing these picks, the point of this post will be to make people stop saying ""*Move Rozier for a pick and move on*,""""*Jaylen and filler for Beal who says no?*"" and *""We need to upgrade!""* without offering any targets.

**The Problem with Picks**

Having 4 first rounders sounds awesome until you realize it isn't. Case in point:

*RJ Hunter.*

The C's selected RJ 28th in 2015, sandwiched between Larry Nance and 4 picks later Montrezl Harrell. A moment of silence please.

The Celtics had 36 games to get a measure of RJ's vitals before pulling the plug. He was simply a roster casualty for the 2016 incoming class of semi-superior youth (Jaylen, Mickey, Jackson) and quality vets (Horford and Gerald Green).

Now, RJ stunk. So no foul there. The issue is A. having to dump a rookie after 36 games is usually bad practice and B. with our next crop of rookies **we don't have either the luxury of giving any of them quality run, nor really waiting to see what happens.**

They're going to be stacked behind (mostly) guaranteed returners (**Kyrie (plz), Hayward, Tatum, Jaylen, Horford, Smart, Baynes**), potential upside youth (**Timelord** and **Semi**) and whatever we get out of the midlevel/ring chasing vets. 

Those end of the bench spots are huge, and maybe filling with one or two rookies is fine (looking at you time-lord). **But filling it with four unreliable guys when we can legit win a title this season (I'm an optimist) or next is wasting our window.** 

Furthermore, the most likely result of atleast three if not all these rooks seeing no minutes is a huge loss in opportunity cost. The loss in value of a sexy first round pick to a bench warming 20 year old is remarkable. You're basically driving your Range Rover off the lot into a sinkhole. This is really dumb as of course rookies need time, but teams are run by owners who don't know anything about basketball, and aren't going to slobbering over how good Jaylen Hands has been in practice. It's always a good idea to have one or two rooks waiting in the wings (paging 2013 Doc Rivers), but less so when the team is already super young, and less so when there's 4 of them.

**Our Options**

**A. Trade for a Star**

This is rather difficult and here's why. Say the Celtics want Bradley Beal. The Celtics as a tax paying team can only recieve 125% of what they send out. With Beal making 26 million, the Celts need to send out about 21 million.

The issue here is who we can send. We can't send Horford or Hayward (especially to the Wiz) because whether you like it or not this team would collapse without Al, and trading Hayward would be lower than IT (and, I mean shit, there's better offers than Hayward and 3 firsts).

The result is cobbling together 21 mil which would require Smart + Jaylen + Morris  + a pick. That is a fucking gutting of our roster and makes us impossibly expensive once we re-sign Kyrie. It seems like a much worse idea than the talent would suggest. I think given our roster, some smaller exchanges make more sense, and are MUUUUCH more likely than the Wiz trading us their best-ish player.

(**Edit: For the record, we can't acquire AD while Kyrie is under his current contract. Outside of Beal, not sure who else is really worth targeting...^Draymond???)**


**B. Kick the can down the road.** Like the C's did in 2016, trade picks (in that case the 31st (Deyonta Davis) and the 35th (Rade Zagorac)) for future assets (the Clippers 2019th 1st).

This would be especially enticing to a team that doesn't have their own pick like the Bucks or Raptors. The issue here is there's a good chance we trade the 24th pick this year for the 28th pick next year, which is by no means a net-gain.

**C. Stash**

Euros!! They're kinda ok sometimes! I'm not going to be an up my own asshole draft evangelist and pretend I know anything about any of them. My impression is that they're like rats in NYC where you know they exist but you don't notice one until they're the size of a weiner dog and just lept out of your trash can.

**D. Trade Up**

I'd argue this is the worst option. Trading up almost always gets you the guy no one really wanted, and just statistically is bad value play. For our roster it will make sense, but unless we can really move up in the lottery, trading say 22 and 25 for 17 is a complete waste of value.

**E. Smaller Trade**

This is, and pretty much always is, the best idea. First rounders are at their most valauble when they aren't players yet, and the Cs should be kicking down doors trying to spend atleast every non Kings pick for an improvement (the Kings pick is really the only likely player to produce next year).

**The Issue**

Again, we have no salary to move!

As I said before, I don't think we can justify trading our top 2 contracts or Kyrie. 

Team wise I don't think we can move Smart in a non-blockbuster (which I donn't think exist anyway), as I think we'd be too soft without him especially for a marginal upgrade.

Thus our moveable salaries are:

Player | Salary
------|------
Morris | 5.0
Rozier | 3.0
Yabu | 2.6
Sleepy | 1.4
Semi | 1.4
Theis | 1.4
Wannamaker | .8
Total | 15.6
Tot Return | 19.5

Now, even that is unrealistic. No team is going to take 7 players in return. Furthermore, we're aiming for salary not quality considering we have picks, so Sleepy and probably Semi are off the table.

The resulting most likely trade is **Morris (who for real is our 3rd best player this year) + Rozier + Yabu.** This is our peak salary flotsam (10.6 mil for 13.25 return), and the least immediate lost value. This can be juiced by adding Smart. I just think that is a bad idea.

**Who can we get?**

This, again, is an issue. Our goal is to find a good player, worthy of immediate value + relative youth + picks, who will fit our team, and makes under 13.5 million. Everyone who does those things are A. on a rookie contract and won't be likely be moved or B. Get paid a max salary.

SO who's out there?



Player | Salary
------|------
Joe Ingles | 12.5
TJ Warren | 11.75
Andre Roberson | 10
Josh Richardson | 9.4
Josh Jackson | 6
Porzingis | 5.6
Malik Monk | 3.3
Luke Kennard | 3.8

Take a look at that list. Notice anything strange about it?...Come on look closely. Oh yeah, that's right, all of those guys won't be traded, are injured, or aren't good!!

Guys like Ingles (although the Jazz should think about it), Richardson, and Porzingis (like, matching salary and 3 picks maybe they think about it) are absolutely worth pursuing but are probably staying put.

After that, we're talking flawed wings in Warren and Roberson, and lottery guys who have struggled mightily.

At the end of the day, my guess is that the bottom row of this list  + Jackson will be our targets. Each are on teams that want to be good right away, could use the immediate impact of Morris/Rozier, and a first rounder will make it too tantalizing to pass up. We can really strong arm a team with a first we don't need, and I think it's smarter getting a guy who's been in the league a bit who can contribute over next years mystery box. You can maybe add to this list a guy like Taurean Prince, but he even might be too good to sell.

I think we'll see a combination of minor upgrades, a trade up, and stashing going on over the season and during the 19' draft.

66,Tournament Report: Top 8 at GP Toronto with Izzet Phoenix and the Power of Sleep Deprivation,233,aplrtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/aplrtb/tournament_report_top_8_at_gp_toronto_with_izzet/,35,1549923252.0,"This is my report of making the Top 8 at GP Toronto by using sleep deprivation techniques to create a more powerful Brain.

I was supposed to fly from NYC to Toronto Friday night, but after my 8:30 p.m. flight was cancelled I was in a pickle. I was already pretty tired from a long week at work, had already been up since just before 7 a.m., and wasn’t sure what to do. I texted my other Magic-playing friends and told them I was probably just going to turn around and go home, but after the gate agent was able to rebook me on an 11 p.m. flight to Montreal, followed by a 5 a.m. flight to Toronto, I decided to stick it out. After all, I had already paid for a hotel room and I was never one to turn down free mini shampoos.

After killing a few hours at the airport bar eavesdropping on three drunk strangers whose flights had also been delayed and who seemed perilously close to having a threesome in the LaGuardia bathroom I was off to Montreal.

You will find a surprisingly large number of people in the Montreal airport at 3 in the morning. What were they all doing there? I had ended up here at this ungodly hour by mistake, but the Quebecois were all striding about with a clear sense of purpose. They were striking early-morning deals, getting a jump start on another productive day in Canada. I tried to find a place to sleep for an hour or two, but there was just too much ruckus. 

I was able to nod off for perhaps an hour on the flight to Toronto, awakened by the rumble of the plane’s wheels touching down and had just enough time to check in to my hotel--to the confusion of the clerk who had assumed I was not turning up--shower, and head to the site. (The hotel unfortunately had no complementary mini shampoo bottles but a system of secure, plastic dispensers affixed to the tiled wall of the shower; a much less wasteful way of doing things, I imagine, but a bit of a disappointment).

I was playing Izzet Phoenix, a deck I’d tested with for about a week prior to the GP. I had been awake for well over 24 straight hours at this point, minus that hour or so of restless slumber on the plane.

[Here is the extremely stock list](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1648174#paper).

**Round 1:** Bye. I did it.

**Round 2: RB Burn.** This was probably the matchup I had been most afraid of coming into the tournament. It felt like flipping Thing In The Ice very quickly was the only way I could get a fast enough clock to win before they drew enough burn to finish me. Blocking with Thing In The Ice is so tempting when they attack into it and it’s just sitting there with its big, frigid, 0/4 booty, but also risks a burn spell removing your only threat. We split the first two games. In the third game I had transformed Thing, sending a Grim Lavamancer and Monastery Swiftspear back to my empty-handed opponent’s hand. I also had another Thing, untransformed, with four counters. I attacked them to 12. For their turn they drew, and recast the Lavamancer. Okay I was expecting that. Then they cast Eidolon of the Great Revel. Turds. I was at 7. I drew for my turn. A Lightning Bolt. That seemed good. It seemed like I could find a way to win with that particular spell. Come on Brain, wake up, I need you to do some thinking for me. I attacked with Thing, no blocks, my opponent is at 5. Hey, my Brain told me, that’s pretty close to dead! If my opponent casts a spell, triggering Eidolon, they’ll be at 3, which is even closer. Was I doing it? I was. Thanks, Brain. I passed the turn. My opponent cast the Monastery Swiftspear I knew was in their hand. Okay, my Brain told me, now is the time to try this thing. My opponent went to 3 off the Eidolon trigger and I cast the Bolt with Swiftspear on the stack. Hurray, we did it, Brain said. Unfortunately my opponent had other plans, and after activating Grim Lavamancer, sending me from 5 to 3, cast a freshly drawn Lightning Bolt sending them to 1 and me to 0. Rats.

L 1-2. Overall 1-1.

**Round 3: Grixis Death’s Shadow.** If I recall correctly, which is far from certain, the first game was fairly close, with Arclight Phoenix managing to deal the final points. My opponent, perhaps sensing that I was in a bad way and could use the help, mulliganed to four in game two. 

W 2-0. Overall. 2-1.

**Round 4:** I don’t remember this one. I am racking my Brain and my Brain doesn’t like that. There is just a hazy sense of something happening, but I’m not sure what. It is even possible that this was the Death’s Shadow match and Round 3 is the blur. Nobody can say. Certainly not my Brain. I was getting near 30 sleepless hours now. I do remember that it was around this time that I started to feel both slightly drunk and like there was no more blood in my body. I thought: Is this what it feels like to freeze to death?

W 2-0 (let’s say it was 2-0, makes me sound better). Overall 3-1.

**Round 5: Dredge**. Prior to this round I remember telling my friends that, somewhat counterintuitively, the exhaustion was helping me play better. Ordinarily, I tend to play too quickly and not think through my plays enough. But because, thanks to the exhaustion, my new, more powerful Brain couldn’t process information that quickly, I was actually being forced to slow down, and plan my turns more carefully. This was the round where that theory was disproven. After stealing Game 1 thanks to a powerful Arclight Phoenix-based draw, I had set myself up well in Game 2. My opponent had started by casting Faithless Looting, discarding a Bloodghast and Life From The Loam. After thinking (for probably longer than I should have needed to) on my first turn I used Surgical Extraction to exile Loam, leaving my opponent with a very anemic and dredge-less first few turns. I landed a Crackling Drake and had my opponent dead in two swings, or so I thought. I had an Izzet Charm and Spell Pierce in hand to protect the Drake. Life was good. I didn’t even mind that my eyes were starting to get so dry from lack of sleep that it hurt to blink. I attacked for what I thought was 10, but I had realized too late that a Thing in my graveyard was a spell, so it was only 9. Whoops. But I had a plan. On my opponent’s end step, with their three lands untapped, I tapped two of my four land to cast Manamorphose. You have to make sure that Drake is lethal, said my Brain. My opponent responding to Manamorphose by casting Lightning Axe and I looked down in befuddlement at the two lands I had untapped, enough to cast one of either Spell Pierce or Izzet Charm but not both. Interesting. Bye bye, Drake. But my opponent continued to struggle to find a card with the word ‘dredge’ printed on it and after drawing Thing In The Ice a few turns later, my Brain’s sins were forgiven.

W 2-0. Overall 4-1.

**Round 6: Humans.** I don’t remember much about this match. I remember at some point casting a Gut Shot on Thalia, Guardian of Thraben. And I believe I won the second game by, at some point, bouncing a problematic Kambal, Consul of Allocation with a Thing In The Ice. The rest is a blur. I think I won in two games, but I cannot be certain.

W 2-0. Overall 5-1.

**Round 7: RB Burn.** I was not excited to play this match-up again, but I was so completely exhausted at this point that I do think it helped to some degree. I didn’t have the energy to feel anxious about a rematch against the deck that had already beaten me. Again, my Brain is hogging most of the memories of this match for itself. I remember there were three games, I remember they were all very close, and I remember Crackling Drake being surprisingly effective. Beyond that, my Brain keeps its secrets.

W 2-1. Overall 6-1.

**Round 8: Hardened Scales.** I felt like I couldn’t ask for much more than making Day 2, given that I am only an average Magic player on the best of days, so from here on out things were just a free-roll and boy oh boy did my play reflect it. I haven’t played much of this match-up but it feels like Game 1 is pretty favorable for Izzet Phoenix—it just seems there aren’t enough answers for Thing in their deck. I won Game 1 in that fashion. In Game 2 my opponent kept a hand with a ton of Animation Modules and hate cards like Grafdigger’s Cage and Damping Spheres. I made the very Powerful Brain play of using a Ceremonious Rejection on a Welding Jar (I had several Abrades in hand, and figured I’d have to answer those Jars eventually), allowing my opponent to resolve a Damping Sphere. That wrecked my grand Arclight Phoenix plans, but I had first one Pyromancer Ascension, then another, and, by casting only one or two spells a turn was able to get them active while my opponent continued to draw sideboard cards, but no pressure. Once both Ascensions were active things got much easier.

W 2-1. Overall 7-1.

**Round 9: Izzet Phoenix.** Ordinarily I would think it was great to get that first round of ‘Day 2’ out of the way on Day 1, but I felt differently on this particular day. I had been up for 36 straight hours. “I will be lucky if I don’t poop my pants in this ninth round,” I messaged my friends. “Noncritical functions are starting to shut down.”

This was basically the mirror, the differences between my opponent had a white splash for Path to Exile and I had Pyromancer Ascension. Based on this match, it seems Ascension is the better mirror breaker. I resolved Ascension on turn two in Game 1 and while the game was very long and complicated the active Ascension was ultimately too good on its own and I won Game 1 after roughly 35 minutes. We picked up the pace to try to get that full match in in Game 2. I had Ascension in my opener again, but held it for the third turn so I could protect it with Spell Pierce, which worked. From there the game started to play out much like the first, but with a lot more Surgical Extraction-ing and both of us trying to go at a brisk pace. With my opponent at 7 I got two Arclight Phoenixes in play and flashed back a Faithless Looting, copying it with Ascension, looking for some way to either remove my opponent’s Crackling Drake or end the game here and now. I found a Lightning Axe but had no way to cast it until my next turn. On my opponent’s turn they noticed that I hadn’t moved that Faithless Looting from my graveyard to exile. After being dinged with a game rules violation by the floor judge, a 10-mnute appeal by my opponent followed in which I longed for sleep, or at least death. The head judge upheld the floor judge’s ruling and I won the match on my next turn. That was a dumb mistake I had made, though at least I had not shat myself. 

W 2-0. Overall 8-1.

I had dinner with some friends who were staying at the Rogers Centre. I had not realized until after we sat down that the restaurant overlooked a darkened professional baseball field. I thought I was hallucinating. “Is this the same place as the SkyDome?” I asked the waitress. She was not certain. I had always wanted to visit the SkyDome, after developing a minor obsession with the early ‘90s Blue Jays after recording some of their playoff games to VHS tapes. Joe Carter! Roberto Alomar! John Olerud and his special helmet! And now I was here, by accident. Or was I?

And then I slept.

**Round 10: RB Burn.** It was a more pleasant, but also less interesting experience, to be playing with a full night’s rest in me. Like both my prior Burn matches, this was a close three-game affair. The third game came down to my Crackling Drake. I was at three and had Dispel in hand. My opponent, empty-handed untapped, drew, and declined to send either of their two creatures into my Drake. On my turn I cast one cantrip and Faithless Looting after another until I had enough Phoenixes in my yard that I could comfortably shock myself to 1 life to play an untapped Steam Vents and attack for lethal. My opponent’s final card was a Searing Blaze and the Dispel was enough to prevent that single lethal damage.

W 2-1. Overall. 9-1.

**Round 11: Tron.** I had been wondering when old Tron would turn up. Game 1 hinged on my opponent’s third turn. They were on the play and had Tron assembled, as they do, and cast Karn Liberated. I had Izzet Charm, the one piece of countermagic I play main, and was able to prevent it. Then on my turn I was able to get several Phoenixes in play, before my opponent’s Relic of Progenitus arrived the following turn. I was able to fight through multiple Ulamogs in Game 2. After dealing some damage with a Thing In The Ice, the first Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger arrived exiling Thing and a red source. I had three Phoenixes in the yard and my opponent at 6, but couldn’t put together the cantrips to return them. That was okay. I now had two tapped red sources and this freshly drawn Manamorphose in hand. I had thirty-odd cards in the library, and a Looting in the graveyard. I could do it next turn. My opponent attacked with Ulamog and then cast another, exiling my only two red sources and putting me in a spot that I will generously call lamentable. I needed to top-deck a red source. I did. A Mountain. Hurray! But now I had to put together three spells and I did not have many lands to work with. After going through my graveyard, sideboard, and exile pile roughly 37 times trying to figure out what colors to make with Manamorphose, my Brain decided I should make blue and red. I drew a blue cantrip, and was able to send Abrade clattering off their Ulamog to return the Phoenixes for lethal.

W 2-0. Overall 10-1.

**Round 12: Tron.** Things lined up well in Game 1, with my opponent’s Wurmcoil Engine not able to block my Phoenixes. In Game 2 I was able to stick a Blood Moon and get some pressure going, but my opponent had multiple Thragtusks to stabilize. I was able, if I recall correctly, to counter the first Oblivion Stone, but not the second. Before my opponent cast the second Oblivion Stone they seemed to briefly tap all eight of their lands, suggesting that perhaps they were considering using Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to exile the Blood Moon instead. On my turn I had a Crackling Drake, Blood Moon, and Negate to choose from, and six lands. I could play Blood Moon and protect it with Negate. But I was now pretty sure my opponent had Ugin and would spend most of their mana doing that. If I could protect Crackling Drake for this one turn by countering Ugin I could attack for lethal on the next. That is what I decided to do and that is what happened.

W 2-0. Overall 11-1.

**Round 13: Ad Nauseam.** I had just sat next to my opponent the round prior and knew they were on Ad Nauseam, which seemed like quite a bad match-up for me going into the round. It still seemed that way after Game 1. I must thank whoever my opponent played in Round 12, because they too were on Izzet Phoenix and I noticed that Blood Moon seemed to have been a potent sideboard card for them. So I decided to try that too. Brain see, Brain do. What is Blood Moon for if not hoping to luckily cheese opponents out of wins in unfavorable match-ups? It worked in Game 2. My opponent cast two scry lands and then never was able to get going after my third-turn Blood Moon. In Game 3 my Brain told me not to cast a Serum Visions on my first turn so that I could hold up Ceremonious Rejection for a turn-two Pentad Prism. That turned out to be a good idea by my Brain because my opponent never drew a third land and my measly single Phoenix was able to do most of the work as I countered additional Prisms or Phyrexian Unlifes cast with the help of Simian Spirit Guide. 

W 2-1. Overall 12-1.

**Round 14: Amulet Titan.** Game 1 was a strange one. My opponent found Amulet of Vigor off their turn-one Ancient Stirrings. I got first one, then two, Things In The Ice into play. I got the first Thing In The Ice down to one counter, but decided not to transform it on my turn. I knew my opponent would be able to resolve at least one, and likely two, Primeval Titans on their turn. So my Brain instructed me to hold onto that Thought Scour, and cast it during their beginning-of-combat step. I was then able to get in a bunch of damage with my two Things, forcing my opponent to cast Pact of Negation on a lethal Lightning Bolt, and obliging them two pay for two pacts (a Summoner’s Pact had also been cast) on their next upkeep, pinching their mana enough that they couldn’t recast a Primeval Titan and give it haste with Slayer’s Stronghold on their turn. That’s what happened. And I was able to win on my next turn. My opponent said after the match they ought to have used Tolaria West to find Engineered Explosives instead to blow up my two Things. They were under the weather with a cold, and from one hindered Brain to another, I empathize. Game 2 was more straightforward, and won on the back of Blood Moon.

W 2-0. Overall 13-1.

**Round 15:** I drew with the eventual champion, Michael Rapp (I believe this is what the kids refer to as a spoiler) and went to get my Brain a snack.

**Quarterfinals: Titanshift.** I had never played this matchup, and I wasn’t sure if it was good or bad for me. I think it is bad, as it turns out. I kept what might have been a poor hand Game 1, on the play. It had some not-very-good removal spells, some cantrips, and Pyromancer Ascension. While Ascension generally shone in grindier matches (and this wasn’t that), I knew Thing In The Ice and Arclight Phoenixes weren’t necessarily reliable thanks to my opponent’s Flame Slashes and Anger of the Gods in the maindeck. So my Brain told me to try it and it didn’t work. I was unsure how many Abrades to bring in for Game 2. Because we got each other’s decklists, I knew my opponent had two copies of Damping Sphere. It’s a fairly problematic card, but would also be the only reasonable target for Abrade. I hedged and brought in one. My opponent resolved one and it put me in a bind. I was eventually able to flip Thing In The Ice and follow it up with a five-mana Crackling Drake to threaten lethal. Now I just had to hope my opponent didn’t have anything. They cast Scapeshift with six lands out and a Khalni Heart Expedition. Okay. I could handle that. They fetched up two Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and two dual-land mountains. On my turn they cracked the Expedition to find more mountains to kill my lethal Crackling Drake. I flashed back Faithless Looting, and found Sleight of Hand. I could cast it for two mana, leaving one untapped. If I found Lightning Bolt I could cast a lethal burn spell on my opponent’s upkeep, when the effects of Damping Sphere were reset. I looked at the top two but it was not there. It was four cards down. My and my Brain had lost.

L 1-2. Bye bye.

That is the story of me and my Brain and Izzet Phoenix. If you are looking to improve your performance at your next event, I highly recommend taking a convoluted series of connecting flights through the middle of the night and depriving your brain of sleep before you get there.

Oh also, when I went to fly home Sunday night I went to the wrong airport in Toronto. My Brain is that powerful."

I fell in love...,226,d2f0ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/d2f0ni/help_i_fell_in_love/,78,1568151563.0,"Bit of a backstory on me: I'm a 37yo father from Germany, I own a house in a rural area and I am currently living there with my wife and two kids (5 and 3). Before that, we lived in Frankfurt for almost 10 years, so I'm used to skyscrapers and not so small citys.
I travelled a lot and saw Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Vienna, Barcelona, Valencia, Paris or Dublin, so I'm used to bigger cities and I very much enjoy visiting and exploring them in depth.

But we went to NYC last week, and boy, was that different from any travel I have done before. The city blew me away at first sight (and sound, and smell, and feel...) to a point I now, back home, feel sehnsucht, a massive urge to come back and dive into the streets again ASAP.
I can't really describe what happened, nor can I make out an exact place or time that struck me, I guess it's just everything.
We had a blast at Coney island, walked the highline, chased rats in Bryant Park in the evening, had funny conversations in the metro, walked all around Roosevelt Island, we ate a diversity of foods, from Ramen (Ivan and Terakawa) to Cajun (Gumbo Bros), from cheap cart hot dogs to expensive Pancakes from 9ten, we made friends with the Egyptian breakfast cart guy in front of our hotel, we felt alone when we wanted to and helped when we needed to, we cried in the 9/11 museum and at the memorial and we ran through the rain with no umbrella just to find out that we don't care! 

Sure thing, all that glitters is not gold, but I just want to state: Hey new yorkers, you have a damn fine city, you are a fine bunch of people with a lot of heart and soul and you prove nearly all american stereotypes wrong! 

I promise that I will do everything in my power to come back, because I'm in love with you!

[the leak that keeps on giving](https://reddit.com/link/9m9w5v/video/lf2whq4onuq11/player)

This is just a few of many photos and videos I have of what I have endured the past 4 months of living in my new apartment on 180 E. 17th St., Brooklyn, NY 11226.  The initial leak started in May and has been a constant in my home and it is now October.  I have had my computer ruined, 2 modems and 2 routers replaced, mold, gnats, flies, carpenter ants, constant mildew stench, no hot water in the mornings the entire month of May, warped flooring, cracked plaster and paint and basically not being able to use a quarter of my living room because there is always risk of water dripping on my belongings.  I have called 311 on them so many times and they have been fined many a time but they don't seem to care!  My property manager will not return my emails or texts.  He has only returned my calls a handful of times promising repairs but every time someone has come to repair I have never seen the walls or ceiling opened up and I have only seen them plaster and paint over when it has leaked and as soon as it rains again, it starts pouring in through my ceiling and walls.  They took 5 months to replace my flooring that was warped allowing the carpenter ants to invade.

I spoke with a tenants’ advocate and she suggested I create a blog and make the address and their name public. She also suggested I send them a link to the photos I post online and that perhaps this will get them to make the repairs I need. She suggested I apply for a rent abatement and take the high road and pay my rent so that they do not take me to court for an eviction non-payment case which could result on getting me on the tenant blacklist.  The blacklist is a serious and real thing.  Once you sue someone its on public record and someone compiles these names and sells this list to real estate and property management companies to ensure these tenants are never rented to again.   So it's a great tactic for slumlords to intimidate their tenants into not taking any real action against them.  It may not happen to you but it's still something to be cognizant of.

&#x200B;

Currently, I have trouble breathing while in my apartment and as soon as I leave I am fine so I know there is mold in the walls but they have repeatedly told me there isn't when they have done nothing to check.  I am at my wit's end.  I have consulted with 2 lawyers and a tenant's advocate and I wanted to put this out into the Redditsphere to see if they would make repairs from some public shaming.  I also just wanted to let everyone know not to rent from these people.  I have made a forum [http://180e17thst.boards.net](http://180e17thst.boards.net) for others renting from them to display their grievances in hopes repairs will be made.  Other people in my building have also had many problems and some of them have been here for years.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, don't rent from these people, and always check the building history and apartment history of whatever you are looking to rent -- ESPECIALLY if it's rent stabilized.  Rent stabilized tenants see the most ill-repair because it behooves the landlords to get as many people in and out of apartments as possible because they can raise the rent each time.  I didn't realize they could do this to rent stabilized apartments. I thought rent stabilized meant they can't raise the rent willy nilly.  So if you see a lot of commotion on a rental history then that is a bad sign.  You can also look up how many violations have been reported on 311 for an apartment.  Be smart when renting in NYC and anywhere!  I've certainly learned a lot with this experience and will be much more savvy next time!

Here is the slumlord's info!  If only we could stick a rat outside our building like construction workers do.

72,Monster Character Profile: Miss Mox,202,gjpwv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gjpwv1/monster_character_profile_miss_mox/,13,1589474505.0,"[previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gjbd6b/monster_chapter_27/) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gknhdi/monster_chapter_28/)

Mox what can we say about Mox? I absolutely love her.

The structure of the story is that the protagonist changes, it's a bunch of anti heroes taking their turn being the monster when they are put in a position of act or die. This is the meaning of the title. But all that said, Mox is by default the main character and Hannah is her foil.

Mox is the most developed character and there is a lot of information and sometimes just suggestions about her sprinkled through the story. I have realized the way this is being released over time as a serial makes it hard to keep up with a character as fleshed out as this. I don't like bloated explanations in the story though so will address this with a canon profile.

If one person asks me a question it suggests 10 or more had the same question and didn't ask.

The question I'm getting is basically how does Mox go from being a biology assistant to mastermind criminal while she is totally loosing her shit. The answers are all the way back through the story starting in chapter 1.

Mox is a spook. She is a Fed Agent like Tirgesh but her department has a narrower focus on synths which are basically bio androids. She hunts down criminal weapons manufacturers and their weapons the same way Tirgesh is hunting her. Tirgesh is from the Ministry of Defense internal affairs.

Mox has degrees in Engineering and Biology with all the underlying fields of study like chemistry. At least one of these degrees is a must for working in her department due to the nature of hunting bio androids. Her having both makes her over qualified but also the top in her field.

From Chapter 1

"" Mox would know since her official title of Chief Science Liaison was pretty words for her real job which was rooting out and disappearing anyone in the galaxy that played around on the wrong side of the line with synth weapons.""

Mox is at the same time lovable and good natured but also a very dangerous individual. When her mind breaks her training takes over and her training is this.

She comes from a family that are real estate developers and was expected to use her natural gifts to carry on this family business. Continuing on the underlying theme of the story that no matter where you go people put their pants on one leg at a time, the family business in this universe is just as slimy as real estate developing is in places like New York City. You don't build a dog house in NYC without the mob involved and greasing the gears of government with cash. So it is in this universe.

Mox learned grift at her Daddy's knee.

She is every bit one of those rich legacy kids who bucks at having her whole life planned out and basically runs away and joins the circus. To say that Father disapproved of her choices is a huge understatement. Lot's of daddy issues causing her to have across the board issues with authority and people in power.

Mox's sanity, oh the fun part.

Mox has been damaged goods crazy all the way through the story it just wasn't an issue until Krelin slammed those blast doors forcing her to take her turn as the monster. It was subtle because she was managing it, but it was there. She does this by compartmentalizing what she doesn't like about her self until she needs it and looking herself in the mirror every morning and telling herself she's the good guy in her story. This is the nexus of the fast switches in her crazy later in the story, she can't manage all of the compartments anymore.

&#x200B;

Mox doesn't do normal relationships.

Mox and Hannah.

Mox does what ever she damn well pleases and then justifies it to herself. The relationship started by her willfully doing something she knew was wrong. Hannah's purity is what the attraction is. Hannah's only sin in the entire story is being born a tragedy magnet, Mox is tragedy with feet.

Mox and Krelin.

2 really smart people who have to make common cause because they give into their impulses and their emotional needs become intertwined in relationships that broke ethical standards of their job missions. Yet both cast judgement on others for the same crime.

And now the one I know y'all have been waiting for.

Mox and Jorin.

This is a simple tale of everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time. You can look around you in life and see this story everywhere.

We are slaves to our coding childishly stomping our feet saying we have free will. The coding says women don't date down and Jorin is simply below Mox's station in every way but maybe decency. No matter how much she actually loves him she she doesn't love him that way, she is a slave to her biology in the evolutionary rat race for resources.

The fact she would commit mass murder to protect him doesn't mean in a moment of weakness she won't destroy him. When she feels weak she punishes him for not being strong and justifies it as giving him something he wants. She acknowledged it was evil before she did it but just did it with a smile.

In one of those cruel the world isn't fair ways she did him a favor leaving him on that station.

&#x200B;

Mox needs love, please don't love her less for being broken."
73,Atmospheric Effects on Sound Propagation,195,bqh6ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/bqh6ga/atmospheric_effects_on_sound_propagation/,21,1558273980.0,"Hello everyone. I am a regular reader of this community, although I usually only post/comment in r/livesound.

I am a system tech, which means that it's my job to design, align, and optimize sound systems of all sizes and scales.

Obviously this job requires an understanding of how sound waves behave in a space, and how that behavior is affected by changes in environmental variables. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/bqbxxg/does_land_elevation_affect_the_way_we_hear_and/) by [u/ProdAG20](https://www.reddit.com/user/ProdAG20/) asking about the effects of elevation on sound and sound perception was filled with a lot of opinions but very little fact. Seeing as we call ourselves *engineers* I think, as a community, we can do better.

* The effects of altitude on the speed of sound are well understood. The math and the physics are well summed up in [this article](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/live-sound/sonic_atmosphere/) by [Merlijn van Veen](http://www.merlijnvanveen.nl/en), who works with Meyer Sound, one of the leading manufacturers of large-scale concert sound systems. Merlijn is probably best known for his [Subwoofer Array Designer](https://www.merlijnvanveen.nl/en/calculators/28-sad-subwoofer-array-designer-en) software, but his article on this topic is informative:

>For gaseous media there’s a push-pull relationship between pressure and density. Equation 2 \[in the [original article](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/live-sound/sonic_atmosphere/)\] shows that pressure and density are proportional to each other when temperature is matched. The ratio of pressure over density is constant, bound by temperature. They follow each other in lockstep.  
>  
>The elasticity modulus for air, mentioned earlier in Equation 1, is proportional to pressure. **As pressure rises, the medium becomes less elastic (stiffer), accelerating the sound speed. However, as pressure goes up, density must follow suit (Equation 2), thereby decelerating proportionally to create a sound speed stalemate (with constant air temperature). Therefore, the speed of sound in Johannesburg at an altitude of 1,750 meters (5,800 feet) is identical to Amsterdam at sea level (as long as the temperature is matched).**

The speed of sound drops in the upper atmosphere, but it's not an issue of chemical composition; it's just [colder](https://www.fighter-planes.com/jetmach1.htm).

* **Temperature** has a straightforward effect on the speed of sound. Warmer air is faster air. You can expect about a 1% change for a 10°F increase. To estimate this, many system techs use v = 1052 + \[1.1F\], where F is temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. (In the US, we often measure the speed of sound in feet per second because it is *approximately* one foot per millisecond (or one millisecond per foot) which greatly eases mental estimation. But you can use Celsius also: 1087 + 2C, where C is temperature in degrees Celsius.
* The only real effect on our day-to-day optimization practices is that if we are working on a *very large* event, the proper timing for the delay / relay loudspeakers can shift slightly when the sun goes down. In most cases, the change is negligible. For example, with delays at 100 feet, the proper delay setting might be 87 ms during the day at 85°F, and 89 ms at night at 60°F. (This is an oversimplification because we don't set delay times at the loudspeaker itself, but it illustrates with real numbers.) This 2ms change is enough to change the sync point by about one seat. It's always swamped by the change in alignment over space due to changing seats - that's just a fact of the physics of delay loudspeakers - and also smaller than the range of delay values that different system techs may use for localization purposes. So that's not really something to be concerned with.
* **What about reflective paths?** A representative situation for a venue might be a direct path length of 20 ms and a wall reflection at 40 ms. The difference in arrival times is 20 ms, which results in a comb filter spacing of 50 Hz. The response has peaks at 50, 100, 150, 200, and so on. (We are of course taking a single reflection out of the context of hundreds, and so the effect of a single reflection in practice is much, much smaller.) If we go through the same temperature change as we did above, the difference in arrival times becomes 20.5 ms. This changes the comb filter spacing to 49 Hz. The response has peaks at 49, 98, 147, 196, etc. This is not something to write home about. To produce an audible change, it would take a large number of very long reflective paths.
* In cold environments, there is a warm layer of air right above the audience, with a cooler layer of environmental air above. This is called an **inversion layer**, and can cause problems for outdoor shows. The sound waves from the PA system can bend up and way from the audience due to refraction (sound travels faster in warm air than cold air) and you can experience a significant drop in SPL in the audience area, and get noise complaints miles away. The best defense against this is to fly the PA, which increases the angle of incidence and decreases the refractive effect.
* At the AES convention last year in NYC, well-known FOH sound engineer Dave Rat presented some research he did into a related effect: he noticed that, during the Coachella festival, for which his company provides audio equipment, there were gaps in the coverage of the delay towers during the day that went away at night after the sun went down. He realized that the sun shining into the mouths of the horns on the PA system heated the walls of the horn, which refracted sound waves inward, narrowing the coverage pattern of the PA. At night, when the sun went down, the effect disappeared. It's not really on topic for this conversation, but it's very interesting.
* **Humidity** is probably the one environmental variable that we have to pay some real attention to in large venues. But not because of its effect on the speed of sound. To quote Merlijn:

>It takes a relative humidity change of 100 percent to cause a negligible 1 meter per second increase in sound speed. Any changes in sound transmission quality will be due much more to the umbrellas than the transmission speed.

The more relevant issue is that air absorbs high frequencies, and humid air lessens this effect. [This prediction data](https://imgur.com/jYHHDcd) shows the behavior of a single Meyer UPQ-1P loudspeaker at 16 kHz (1/24 oct) at 30%, 60%, and 90% relative humidity. In drier air, we have to boost a little more HF on the loudspeakers covering the furthest throw distances. This is something we can accurately predict with software, and accurately measure with an analyzer. This is the single biggest environmental variable that can change during the show and require attention from the system tech.

&#x200B;

In terms of **perception**, our hearing mechanism responds to short-term modulations in the ambient air pressure, not absolute changes in that air pressure. In electronics terms, our hearing is AC coupled. Your hearing test should come out the same at 3,000 ft and at sea level, provided you've been there for a couple of days. The *change* in altitude can cause a temporary attenuation, metaphorically a DC offset in your eardrums, particularly if you change altitudes quickly. (This is why your ears pop.)

There is a [small amount of evidence](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/26/3/161.full.pdf) \[PDF\] to suggest that very high altitudes can detrimentally affect the ability to localize sound (tell where a sound source is located). However the research is not conclusive as to the cause, and the same study used puretone tests (audiograms) to show that gradual ascents didn't alter the absolute hearing thresholds of the test subjects. On rapid changes in elevation, there is an elevation of thresholds (your hearing can be temporarily impacted after flying on a plane, for example). This is something that can be a cause of concern for touring engineers who have to mix a show immediately after flying.

For those interested in system optimization topics, there is a [pinned post on my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/IHateTypingInBoxes/comments/b5jwqh/sound_system_optimization_post_archive/) with lots of resources.

Cheers."
74,Match Thread - Liverpool vs Sporting - 24/7/2019,190,chg43a,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/chg43a/match_thread_liverpool_vs_sporting_2472019/,1192,1564012566.0,"Greetings from New York City, the City That Never Sleeps. That's mainly due to the howling of all the crazy people. 
We come to you tonight from historic Yankee Stadium, home of NYCFC, The New York Yankees, and their most famous tennents, millions and millions of rats.

Current weather is ideal for football, with a temperature of 78 F. What's not ideal will be the pitch. NYCFC is well known for having a, shall we say, sub-optimal pitch configuration. 

Jurgen Klopp puts out a strong side to start, with Mignolet starting between the sticks. VVD and Matip team up in the defence, and our traditional wide backs are, well, back. The Ox rampages back into action in a 4 person midfield. Although, to be honest, my app is showing Wijnaldum as a striker, so I think whomever put the lineup in got some bad meth.

Sporting counters with - {looks at lineup} 11 players. A couple of the names look pronounceable.

- -10 or so minutes: The studio hosts just mentioned Couthino. BRB, going to punch them in the face.

-**MATCH FACT**: NYC is the home of the famous Statue of Liberty, which reacted faster than any Barcelona player to TAA's corner.

- -8 or so minutes: The match is delayed while Liverpool visits with Sporting and remind them what the definition of ""friendly"" is.

- At least the studio crew shut up for most of YNWA.

- 1' Sporting get us underway. Unfortunately, someone left a highlighter in the wash with their shorts. Liverpool are wearing their new away kit.

-2' An early chance, as Fabhino feeds a tempting ball in for Origi, who arrives a fraction too late, allowing the goalkeeper to disrupt the shot.

- **MATCH FACT** Yes, that is the entire pitch.

-4' **GOAL Liverpool 0 - [1] Sporting** A calamity at the back, as Mignolet bobbles what should have been an easy save. Allison suddenly remembers why he's got the #1 jersey.  https://streamable.com/jc4zk

-12' A promising corner is plunked off the crossbar, but is blown dead due to...well, something. Foul maybe. I didn't see anything.

**MATCH FACT** You don't have to be named Super Bock to play for Sporting, but it certainly helps.

-17' CLOSE from VVD! A corner is headed goalwards, but is well-saved by the Sporting keeper. 

**MATCH FACT** During that header, VVD was the 4th tallest building in NYC.

-19"" **GOAL Liverpool [1] - 1 Sporting** Origi draws us level!! Robertson's cross is inch-perfect to Henderson, who forces a top class save. However, the rebound goes to Origi, and there was only 1 result possible.

**NYC FACT** In NYC, Football ---&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Soccer, and ""Cheers Mate"" -----&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Go fuck yourself

-29"" A very harsh tackle on Gini leads to the game's first yellow card. Apparently ""Friendly"" doesn't mean what I thought it meant.

**MATCH FACT** The advertisements at Yankee Stadium are an excellent example of New York's famously understated style.

-34' OFF THE POST. A curler from Sporting eludes Mignolet, but hits the uprights, rebounds back off of Migs and goes safely out of play. The resulting corner looks dangerous, but results in nothing.

-37' Easy there James. A hard foul results in a pause for the Sporting player to receive treatment.

-38' Say what you want about the Premier League and the UCL, but who among us didn't dream of lifting the Western Union Cup?

-43"" **GOAL Liverpool [2] - 1 Sporting** The Ox places a cross to noted striker Gini Wijnaldum, who hits one off the Sporting defender and in. Mo Salah decides to take another week off.

-45 + 2':  BRILLIANT DOUBLE SAVE BY MIGS! Simon denies Sporting on the doorstep twice in rapid succession. Some quality stuff there from Migs.

HT: Liverpool 2 - 1 Sporting

OP's going for a drink. I'll be back for the 2nd half.

**HT FACT** Listening to the TNT studio crew qualifies you for hazard pay.

46': OP's got a Diet 7 Up, Liverpool has the lead, and it's time for the 2nd half.

**NYC FACT** NY style pizza is demonstratably inferior to both Chicago and Detroit style pizza.

-53' **GOAL LIVERPOOL 2 - [2] SPORTING** Sporting cuts through the Liverpool defence a little too easily, leading to a goal from about 15 yards out. No hope for Migs there. I for one am glad that we're getting all these mistakes out of the way in the pre-season.

-56' VVD CLOSE AGAIN! Another corner, another VVD header inches away. This time, the post foils his chance. Surely he's got one in him tonight?

-60' Many subs by both teams.

**OP FACT** Ladies, OP is single! You could laugh as hard as you do during his match threads every day, especially when he takes his pants off. Wait, did I type that out loud?

-64' Matip introduces his chicklets to a Sporting player's head. Both are ok to continue.

-69' (nice) Proper save from Migs from just outside the penalty area.

**MATCH FACT** If this match ends tied, they should definitely just saw the trophy in half on the pitch.

-75' A lot more changes for both sides. Coming on is Adam Lallana, who has been removed from his protective bubble wrap for this match.

-81' Under 10 minutes to play, and the cup hangs in the balance. Who will add their name to the list of Liverpool cup-winning legends????

-86' Mignolet continues to audition for the role of back-up left back.

-89' New red Sepp Van Den Berg makes his debut. He was supposed to come on at halftime, but they needed to find extra spaces for his last name.

-FT: Liverpool 2 - 2 Sporting.

Some final notes:

-No, I am not covering the trophy ceremony

- Liverpool's USA tour comes to an end, as they fly back across the pond. Sporting also heads...well...somewhere nice I hope.

- Liverpool face off next against Napoli in 4 days time.

Thanks for joining me all. Time for a Ribena."

**Part 1**

The first flakes fell gentle, like shredded up paper swirling down to the ground. And we cheered, those of us celebrating in NYC that night, seeing in the new year with friends and wine and laughter.

We woke with sore heads to a changed cityscape. A frozen veil had softened the harsh lines and dimmed the bright lights. A few inches overnight. Kids were out making snowmen while grownups hung their heads out of windows like dogs in the car, admiring what the dirty city had become. An open air art gallery -- minimalism gone mad.

I made a coffee and turned on the radio. The voice was already fuzzed with static. Soon it'd be gone altogether.

*A miracle, folks! Snow all around the world, like we're in a big glass globe and someone's just picked up the planet and given it a good shake. Let's rewind a few weeks and get the holiday music back on the air!*

It didn't even take a day for the first building to fall. The roof of the house was almost flat, perfect for snow to settle on. After that, it was winter-white dominoes. Clunk, clunk, clunk. New York began to fall. And what didn't fall was slowly suffocated as the snow crept up over the remaining buildings' necks.

We scurried like rats into the sewers, into the subways, into anywhere deep enough and strong enough to hold, as the snow pressed down hard on the city's chest.

And so it ended for us. Life was over, at least as we knew it. Most died. And those few unfortunates that lived began life anew. Had to.

New religions blossomed overnight, with followers that worshipped gods of fire or ice. Sacrifices were made daily in their honour by crazies. Clans became both family and protection.

Life anew was life cursed.

Me? What did I become in this cold new world beneath the earth? Well, I'm a burrower.  Forget electricity or machinery or any shit like that -- that's all long gone. We burrow with spades and heat. Me, Claire, Ricky -- my crew. We're part of the Flat Iron clan. Eighty of us total.

Now burrowers, if I do say so myself, have the most important role in any clan. We carve the tunnels in the belly of the snow that allow us up into the clogged throats of the ruined buildings of NYC. We hollow tunnels that allow us to transport goods, tunnels that allow us to fall on enemy clans unexpected, tunnels that allow us to expand.

Today, when we were tunneling, *everything* changed.

We were burrowing upwards, looking for food in the ruins. Nothing new in that.

But we didn't mean to reach the surface -- didn't expect to. Never thought we'd see it again, in truth. But the snow had, at some point in the last few years, stopped falling; we burst out to a white land glittering under starlight.

For a moment, we celebrated.

Then, we saw them.

We sure as fuck hadn't expected to find that God himself had arrived -- that the crazies had been right all along. The snow... it'd just been rolling out the red carpet for Him. A way of purifying the planet for His landing -- Him and his demented angels.

We stayed up there, watching, for too long. Too careless -- 'cause they saw us  and they know there are survivors, now.

They're coming down the burrows to get us.

To purify the earth entirely.

A game of literal chicken between superpowers.  However, in September of last year, it became apparent that the US was losing the trade war and the fed repo window opened. (CIA implemented plan B)  China was looking to break ties with the US, seizing our factories and turning to Europe.  Italy was one of the first to sign onto the deal, pissing the US off.  This is a quick overview to bring you up to our current timeline.

A decision was made to punish China. For stealing our technology and threatening to seize our factories, effectively destroying the US.  So we unleashed (yes, we did it) a virulent version of Covid-2 (SARS), the world was introduced to Covid-19.  The stage was set and the plan was hatched, China, North Korea, iran and italy would see the US military might.  However, there was a problem.  The US hides bases around the world to torture insurgents and work on secret military projects.  One was a lab in wuhan, the chinese moved in fast, secured the lab and using CRISPR technology,  attempted to send the US a present in return.  All the while, they used horrific and draconian measures to contain America's gift.  America played the role of the good guy, offering help and temporary tariff relief, China refused and started to liquidate US treasuries.  Their retaliation was quiet and swift.  The fed began frantically cutting rates to ease Chinas predictable response.  The US quickly deescalated its 19 year war in Afghanistan.  America was getting prepared to respond to their own creation. (SEP 2019 - Jan 2020)

  Now we look at China in January/February, alone and battling a man made virus that overwhelmed the medical system, however they had our factories and countless ""prisoner"" laborers set forth to produce massive amounts of medical supplies,pharmaceuticals and  equipment.  Built a massive hospital to ease the pressure (in 10 days, impressive) Meanwhile, Chinese scientists manipulated the Covid-19 virus, included segments of HIV to give it a ""trojan horse"" effect.  They told the world the virus they were battling was aerosolized virus that, showed a long incubation period with asymptomatic transmission.  Our scientists heard this, scratched their head, why?  Because that is not what they sent to Wuhan.  It didn't take long for our idiots to realize China was about to unleash version 2.0 on the world.  US halted travel to and from China, too little too late.  Our congress members were briefed about what was coming, they panicked, dumped their stock and called their corporate friends.  CEOs began to resign immediately.  Knowing they had to flee quickly.  They knew what was coming.
(Jan /Feb 2020)

  Thousands of infected chinese and foreign nationals flew out of China and seeded the world.  China realized their friend list was small, so they contacted them and explained what the US had done.  Russia went after the Petro dollar, goaded Saudi Arabia into a price war.  This would destroy Americas oil dominance and put stress on the dollar.  The European countries were unfortunately clueless to this major chess play (except Great Britain).  The original seed was planted, along with version 2.0 in italy.  Iran was spared China's ""gift"" however, they are struggling with the American version.  North Korea got the 1.0 version also and made swift moves to show they had it contained by firing a warning shot at japan. (Because the country is run by a childish dictator) .  Now we look at the poor Italians.  They became ground zero for a war between superpowers.  They face both strands of the virus.  Nearly identical RNA virus with 50+ add-ons from china to its ""code"" of 20,000.  (Simple terms) America scrambled to get the 2.0 version in their hands.  (Feb 2020 - beginning of March 2020)

  The heads of Americas government were in disarray, they were prepared for version 1.0, remember the e-cig ""lung disease"" that was your clinical trials.  As the new version took hold, a mass panic took place, a scramble to get medical supplies,equipment and drugs.  China is now back to attacking the US with limiting the supplies and creating artificial scarcity (and gouging our hospitals).  China is showing the US that they are in control now.  The panic our government is showing is not because many of our citizens will die.  They dont give a rat's ass about you.  It's that trillions in market cap and the fabric of the Petro dollar are being destroyed.  The very rich are going to precious metals, the price was artificially pushed down to gobble up all they can. (It has always been the ""only"" global currency.) They are now fleeing the country, heading to Australia, New Zealand, several Caribbean islands and South America.  Now Trump realizes just how deep the deep state is.  In his mind he feels betrayed and left holding the bag.  He would rather get a phone call as a businessman so he can save his own hide.  However, he is now the leader of the free world.  He realizes he made a mistake thinking he could get a handle on this countries shitty decisions (CIA, deep state). The CIA is in charge, make no mistake.  They have subverted our government. 
    The fed is firing everything they have and ballooning their balance sheet to prevent our fragmented supply chain from collapsing.  Grocerers and suppliers are forcing their employees to work and tensions are skyrocketing.  The food supply chain has been contacted directly and told it your patriotic duty to help America in it's time of need.  Your employer is ready to replace you if and when you get sick, trust me on that.  We are now in a race against time.  Stupid decisions like allowing spring breakers to party on beaches are no mistake.  They bring much needed revenue to this fight for financial survival. As Americans rise up, walk out and refuse to work (NYC transit) the government cuts its loss and quarantines.  That is a contagion they can't have. The gears of the economy grinding to a halt scares them far greater then throwing your grandmother in an incinerator.  (Morbid reference I know) .... (March 2020)

So where are we now?  As this disease spreads and we race to find a treatment, be prepared for more draconian measures.  Americans in ""essential"" jobs  will likely be forced to work (with hazard pay, because you might not survive),  and possibly be quarantined at their job sites to separate them from those on home isolation.  Factories will be retooled and force workers to return. We will continue to blame China, scramble to get supplies and test kits out.  We are not prepared to deal with both versions.  (That is why the first batch ""failed"", 2 different strands) We will experience a nasty battle, but in the end, we as Americans will survive this.  

What will be the death toll?  Worldwide I think it will surpass around 2 million, America will see 400k of that.  An antiviral will be rushed out and the epidemic will subside, however America will be forever transformed.

   The economic nuclear bomb we just got hit with will either bring us to a world war, or we will finally capitulate and accepted our new 2nd tier status.  If we choose the latter, China will place the Yuan as the new global currency.  They will no longer manipulate its value and it will soar, the US dollar will experience hyperinflation.  Historians will dub this decade as the 2nd great depression.  Many jobs will trickle home, and some companies will leave America to make China their new home.  (Apple, Nike, etc).  This to me seems the most likely scenario.

If we choose war, we will put up a valiant fight, however our allies are weak both financially and militarily.  It will be a long, bloody conflict, with no clear winner.  Every country will be in economic ruin, with several revolutions taking place.  I can't even envision that scenario.


This is my ""conspiracy theory"" , I hope you enjoyed the long read.  Everyone be safe, and please stay calm for the children.

Update: ""Did our country just retaliate with more bioweapons, china is reporting new viruses (speculation)...Mar 23

Update: March 26th.  The United States surpasses the world in total infectious cases.  I am posting this update to continue to ""strengthen"" my conspiracy.  
#1 Russia had nuclear subs parked off of the eastern coast of the US and nobody had a clue.  (Except our pentagon)
#2 I've been using google scholar to paw through medical papers (published) from the different hubs of academia.  I've come across some bone chilling articles.  Including one from Oxford directed to mortuaries.  (They are not the only source saying this) as of March it is the conclusion that covid-19 possesses an infectivity rate higher than tuberculosis.  It warns workers to take extreme precautions when disposing and caring for the dead.  (Thus why China burned the bodies)

Update: Mar 29th - The U.S. administration is currently receiving alot of flak because on Feb 17th we shipped 13 tons of masks to china.  This supports my theory that our government was clueless.  I'm sure the CIA advised against this, but were ignored.  Hubai province is becoming unstable, it will be interesting to see this development.  Americans are becoming impatient and demanding a return to life, believing the media who is largely dismissing the danger we face.  Remember everyone we had 77 cases on march 1st.  It appears China is moving naval assets around Taiwan, the US has 1 warship in the straits of taiwan."
79,That time I let a customer get to me...,176,9z7nga,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/9z7nga/that_time_i_let_a_customer_get_to_me/,31,1542836367.0,"I worked briefly for the sister store of the moderately-priced, family-friendly store that sells flip flops. I worked at this store in an upscale, high end mall in New Jersey about 15 miles from NYC. To give you some perspective, this mall did not have a food court because it did not want to attract a certain type of person (“mall rats”) and the store that I worked at was certainly considered on the lower end compared to most of the other stores (Burberry, Coach, etc).

Anyway. I was working a Saturday shift and was asked to cover the fitting rooms for another coworker’s lunch break. A woman walks in with all of these clothes, tries them on, makes me grab other sizes, etc. I’m used to this level of service for the type of customers we get. She’s not rude, per se, but really demanding and needy.

She finally goes to the register and sees something she wants on hold for another customer at the counter. She asks if she could have it and I said it was on hold. I asked her if she wanted me to find another one in a store nearby or online, but she refused and was adamant she wanted that one.

I finally put my foot down and said no. From here on out the customer will be called Delusional Customer or DC for short. She finally accepts reality about the item on hold but does something I had never experienced before in my retail days.

DC: Where’s my purse?

Me: I’m not sure...

DC: I had it when I walked into the fitting room. Where did you put it?

Me: I didn’t put it anywhere.

At this point I’m struggling to remember if I had even seen her purse at any point, and frantically tried to search for it in our fitting room. I got nervous because she’s getting louder and I’m starting to panic because this attention is being put on me.

DC: Where the fuck did you put my purse? Did you steal it? You stole my purse!

At this point my manager intervened and asks the customer what’s wrong. That’s when I lost it.  I started crying and had to go to the back. I know I didn’t steal her purse but she’s loud, I feel defenseless, and I don’t like all this attention on me.

We were able to determine the customer never brought her purse in at all. She never apologized to me or my manager. She left without buying anything either.

That was the first and hopefully last time a customer made me cry😂"

81,Quality of life improvements in NYC,176,j956n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/j956n8/quality_of_life_improvements_in_nyc/,167,1602421993.0,"I'm very big into ""quality of life improvements"" -- things that will make my life easier or more comfortable. To that end, i have been compiling a list of some NYC specific ones:

1. Noise cancelling headphones. I cannot recommend these enough. They make the ambient noise so much more tolerable, so much so i can *read* on the train. Right now i'm using [these bose headphones.](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/noise-cancelling-headphones-700.html#v=noise_cancelling_headphones_700_triple_midnight) They're among the best on the market for noise cancelling, but some other bose models are superior in other aspects.
2. Sound dampening blinds & curtains. These also happen to be very good at blocking light to, as well as keeping heat out in the summer, so I consider that a triple win. For blinds you specifically want [cellular shades](https://www.lowes.com/pd/allen-roth-AR-1-5-in-White-Blackout-Recycle-Cellular-Shade-34x64/1002819654) (or so i've read are the best for sound dapening). For curtains you'd want something thick, they sell curtains that promise to deaden sounds ([like these one's I got](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KNQ7XZZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)). The curtains and the blinds combined do make a meaningful difference for certain ""frequencies"" if I understand correctly. They don't keep all the sound out, especially lower sounds like heavy bass, but they make a difference with things like fireworks or that constant ""low level"" din you always hear throughout the city.
3. Rugs & Rug pads! This is in a similar vein as the above for noise reduction. Half the issue with noise is it getting into the apartment, the other half is it staying in the apartment. If you have a pre-war apartment with a high ceiling like myself then you likely have a terrible echo. A police siren driving by makes that echo infinetly worse. Putting rugs down and pictures on the wall has decreased the meaningfully. The rugs also makes footstep noise much more tolerable, and *maybe* keeps some sound out of the apartment for people below me and such. **If you have kids or a dog, seriously consider getting good rugs and a rug pad**, for neighbor below you will be thankful. Rug pads make the carpets signficantly more comfy and effective.
4. A good backpack (preferably expandable). My old military backpack broke, and i just got this [this](https://missionworkshop.com/products/the-vandal) as a replacement. The expaning from 29L to 60+ is awesome.
5. A sun hat. The sun here is harsh. A good widebrim hat will help keep you much cooler (in addition to preventing sun damage to you skin and eyes), you'll show up much less sweaty to places, and feel much more comfortable walking outside in he sun. [This is what i use.](https://www.columbia.com/p/bora-bora-ii-booney-CU9107.html) You may look a bit silly (hat dependant), but you'll feel a lot better walking in the sun, as well as save your skin and body. 
6. Hand sanitizer on a keychain. Quite a few people do this now as well. I highly recomend it, even if you don't give a rats ass about Covid, it's nice to still have clean hands.
7. Earplugs! I sleep in earplugs, and its made sleeping much more comfortable. It took me a while to find an earplug that i was happy with (i have small ear canals apparently), but they are worth the effort. [These are what i use](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RMFGGY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apip_z3QHHeDA1lupS), a new pair every other night. So about a years worth for <$20
8. [Alpine Cockroach bait](https://www.amazon.com/Alpine-Cockroach-Bait-Rotation-Reservoir/dp/B0881LVXDQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=alpine+cockroach+gel+bait&qid=1602423311&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFHUUc2WDdCVDhGMEImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxMjk5MDUzR0IyNk9NVlM5T0g1JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyNDA2NzIzVUw5NE1QOEZTNUdRJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==). This stuff changed my life significantly. I used to see 10+ roaches a day. Everytime i walked into the kitchen or bathroom i was guaranteed to see a roach. Now I maybe see a roach once a week. Note: This stuff will cause the roachpocalypse. Shortly after putting it down the amount of roaches you see (and their behavior) will be crazy!

That's all the NY specific one's I got, does anyone have any more?

\--------

Here are some misc quality of life improvements i'd suggest:

\- An electric toothbrush. If you're like myself and brush half assedly, and sometimes skip brushngs, then an electric toothbrush will help pick up the slack. But regardless, i think it is still an excellent investment.

\- If you smoke weed regularly: A vaporizer. [I use this](https://arizer.com/solo2/), though preferences vary. Bonus points if you run the vapor through water. You'll save weed, be more discrete, and feel better physically and mentally"

 * [Politico: President Donald Trump ‘Preparing For The Worst’ In Mueller Probe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d7GHMgQPeg) [9:54]

>Even with with his die hard loyalist Matthew Whitaker leading the DOJ, Trump appears stricken with fear about Mueller's next move, perhaps for good reason.  As Politico reports late today, ""...a deep anxiety has started to set in that Mueller is about to pounce... and that any number of Trump's allies and family members may soon be staring down the barrel of an indictment.""

-

>How does Trump get away with what looks to be coming at him perhaps the next several days or weeks which is indictments of his family members, indictments of people who would screw him, rat him out like Roger Stone.  He could rat him out, he's got a bunch of stuff going back for decades. And of course, you know, impeachment.

-

>...This is the first time, I think, in Trump's life that he has come up against a criminal investigation.  He's had some luck in civil courts.  This is Robert Mueller, former Director of the FBI, this is not a group of angry Democrats but rather a group of very well experienced, very straight up the middle prosecutors who now have to go about their jobs.  I don't believe that this group breaks and bends because the president blusters.  I'm sure he has the pardon power, and he can pardon people who aren't himself, at least to a certain extent.   And maybe that gets some of his friends out of trouble, but **what he can't do is use the pardon power to keep people, for instance Roger Stone, from providing prosecutors with evidence against him, from cooperating with prosecutors because if he uses the pardon power in that way it's just an additional layer of obstruction.**  I don't think Mueller will go after him with kid gloves as regards the president obstructing justice or doing anything that undermines the rule of law.

 * [Indictments Coming? What Mueller's Latest Move Means For President Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nXEOv2dKV4) [8:11]

>...The court filing said the delay will provide the court with a report that will be of greater assistance in the courts management of this matter.  After reading this news earlier tonight, former Assistant US Attorney for the SDNY and currently a member of our team of legal analysts wrote this on Twitter: ""Reading tea leaves, [and we love when he does that], Manafort's cooperation is relevant to something that will happen in the next 10 days.  Since next week is Thanksgiving, I'm betting on indictment(s) tomorrow.  Could just be Stone.  But could be more too.""

-

>How do you read this court filing?  

>A tantalizing tidbit for those of us waiting for the main course... What it's telling us is that [Manafort] is still providing information that's useful.  **They want to probably indict, as Dan says, and the question is who, and that Manafort has been useful in that process and that's why it will be more helpful to the court for them to be able to share where they are and what that means for sentencing.**

-

>I agree with Maya, I think something's afoot.  What is it? This begs the question.  What is it that's going to transpire in the next several days that is going to give the court a much greater insight into the level of cooperation of Manafort, and why would both sides agree to this delay.  This is unlikely to be a negative slap against Manafort and a lack of cooperation, but rather **those days are going to permit the Mueller team to point to some indictments and say Manafort did this, he helped us with this, here it is.** They're not ready to tell us what that is yet, they're not ready to tell the court yet, but it's coming.

>... I think the Special Counsel team is recording and documenting all of the public outrage and tweets and it's all going on a timeline as to what happened when, what triggered this, whether or not this involves witness tampering or intimidation.

85,"I just got an ""A"" from the health department.  Some thoughts from a chef on inspections in nyc.",165,fckqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/fckqp/i_just_got_an_a_from_the_health_department_some/,62,1296503698.0,"x-post from [/r/KitchenConfidential](http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/), a new reddit for restaurant workers.

*I'm Executive Chef of a fine dining restaurant in nyc, just so you know my perspective...*

Everyone with any restaurant experience knows that health inspections are extremely stressful.  During inspection, most managers and chefs are freaking out, causing the rest of the staff to do the same.  For good reason too...not a lot of restaurants survive for long after being shut down for health code violations.  

Last summer NYC changed its system from what was essentially pass/fail to a letter grade system: 0-13 points for an A, 14-27 points for a B, and a C for 28 points and above.  28 points (now a C grade) remains constant as the ""fail""-point, requiring monthly re-inspections until the point total falls below 28 or the restaurant is shut down by the city.  The point system, inspection procedure or regulations didn't change at all...what changed was the letter grading and the added rule that the it had to be posted ""where they can easily be seen by
people passing by.""

And it's a critical change at that.  For every restaurant in the city to be required to post a [giant letter grade](http://i.imgur.com/7kKRp.jpg) from the department of health on the front door is no joke.  I've always run a very clean kitchen...for the benefit of sanitation and of staff discipline.  Even I was fucking scared as hell.  

Why soil ourselves so badly?  

Well, having everyone that's walking in or walking by see a letter grade on your front door or window is a big fucking deal.  Even bigger than most think.  It doesn't matter if people don't know what that grade really means (and they don't).  People will see an ""A"" and feel great about going in.  People will see a ""B"" or ""C"" and the reaction would be anywhere from turned off to being completely disgusted.  The nyc restaurant scene is absolutely cut throat, too many restaurants...and no matter what you're offering, someone else is doing the same.  So, for taco restaurants the competition went from all *restaurants serving tacos* to *restaurants serving tacos that have an ""A"" hanging on their door*.  The other places are irrelevant and cannot compete to make real money and/or survive until they achieve the ""A"".

New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene knows this and it is in fact the point of it all.  They’re working to make restaurants take their inspections  even more seriously or risk going out of business.   Which sounds great to just about everyone too.  But there are a couple of major problems here…

**1) The outcome of health inspections are often unpredictable and depend on a number of uncontrollable factors.**

This. Is. Fact. Ever been to the DMV?  Or the post office?  Or the police station?  I'm not trying say people in civil service are all terrible, I'm saying they're super inconsistent.  One day you go to the DMV and the person is an absolute delight...efficient, friendly, helpful with addressing your concerns.  The next time you get someone who couldn't care less about you and doesn't mind letting you know it.  Or sometimes you get pulled over for speeding and the officer lets you go with a warning.  Other times he/she gives you the ticket while looking for reasons for more, giving you a condescending lecture the whole time.  Not sure why but people in civil service seem to be the most inconsistent workforce anywhere.  Maybe it's the hiring procedure, or the candidates they receive, or the nature of the job and their salaries?  Or maybe they're just as inconsistent as any other group, it's just that we expect them to be otherwise.

Well, health inspectors are civil servants too, and are *wildly* inconsistent.  Some of them are strict and thorough, but use common sense and reason to guide their process making them fair.  Some of them seem to be out to find every single violation or hint of one in an effort to inflict the most damage on your business during their visit.  Some of them don't really care about any of it and breeze through the inspection.  I guess they're human, and the worst of them are technically abiding by the rules stated.  So is the cop that adds on a ticket for not using the turn signal while pulling over.  Just saying that the inspector you draw is a huge factor that you have no control over.

Also, **restaurants are fucking crazy.** Huge places filled with food, employees, customers, garbage, chemicals, fire, water and anything else you can think of.  A restaurant is like a living being and to judge it based on a snapshot taken at a random moment is a problem itself.  Again, we got an ""A"" on our inspection, but I'll tell you right now there were days when we wouldn't have.  The day fruit flies just showed up and decided to make a home in our lounge.  The day the street pipes got all messed up and flooded a corner of the basement.  Or when one of the fridges was running a few degrees warm.  Sometimes one of our 80 employees forgets to label something or the steward misses a dented can and puts it on the shelf with the others.  A million things can and will go wrong on any given day, and of course we deal with them quickly to get everything soignee again. But should you be having a bad day and the inspector arrives, all you can do is scramble a bit and pray you don't get points for it.  Which brings up the other thing...

**2) People have no fucking clue what an A, B or C grade really means.  Meanwhile they're being encouraged to make decisions based on them.**

Decisions that affect small businesses.  Small businesses that each employ anywhere from a handful to hundreds of people.  It's not hard to predict a diner's thought process in relation to health department letter grades.

**I'm only going to restaurants with an A!**

*Um, excuse me.  I'm sorry to bother you but...do you know what the grades really represent?  You know, a B grade actually isn't th...*

**I don't care!  A's are better than B's!  Everyone knows that from years and years of school!!  Why would I go somewhere that's not as good?**

And that diner is right.  There's no reason for anyone to go to any restaurant without that **A**.  On top of that, someone sees a **B** and thinks ""Oh, they didn't get an A.  I wonder why?"", and proceeds to think about rat droppings, cockroaches, fight club, etc and runs away disgusted.

But do you know what makes a **B**?  Well we said already it's 14 points.  Points come from violations.  Some examples (each violation's point value has a range, the inspector is to judge the severity and assign the actual points):

Side towel left on counter top - **5 to 7 points**

Refrigerator above 41°F (even 1°) - **7 to 10 points**

Refrigerator missing thermometer - **2 to 5 points**

Any fly (*food and/or non-food areas*) - **5 to 8 points (28 if it's really messed up like Temple of Doom style I guess)**

Aaaaand we're at around 20 points!  Don't forget that these violations' points sometimes stack too. So for instance, if there's another side towel sitting out somewhere during the tour it would add another 5 to 7 points.  That would put us in **C** territory.  On a side note, having a larger restaurant with more employees is obviously a huge disadvantage.

The point is that the letter grade **doesn't actually mean anything close to what is being perceived.**  How about a 13 point **A** vs a 14 point **B**?  Or two **B**s but one had rotten meat on the hot line and the other got 6 points because a line cook was drinking a cup of water in the kitchen? (Yes, that's a violation)

Here's [Grace Green on Huff Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/19/city-inspections-reveal-n_n_810872.html) with a typical clueless blog post.  She gleefully says that Le Cirque and Gramercy Tavern (large, well known restaurants here) received **C**'s, indicating they had over 28 *violations* which is plain wrong.  28 *points* make a **C**, and we don't know how many violations.  Again, you don't know because you can't tell because the letter grade doesn't have that information.  This is someone writing an article on the subject and still has no idea how the system works and what the grades mean.   The hilarious thing is that they don't mean anything until you investigate the violations.  (You can find full details on each restaurant's inspection [online](http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do) but I seriously doubt anyone is going to bother to look past the letter grade)

And so these are the grades that everyone in the city are now judging us on.  And it's a shame.  I'm all for strict health and safety standards for diners and employees everywhere.  But the DHMH didn't think this through before implementation.  It's made slipping on a health code a potential death blow to an entire business and the income of its employees.  

I take great pride in the work I do, as do the vast majority of us in the industry.  Like I said, it's competitive, but that's a good thing.  If you're running a restaurant, no matter who you are or where you work...in this town you're battling guys like Mario Batali, Daniel Boulud, Eric Ripert, Nobu, and Gordon Ramsey every single night to get people into your seats.  The criteria should be the product we work to produce, as a whole.  Certainly our health and safety standards are part of that.
 
But as it is, it's about that damn letter grade first.  Just doesn't seem right.


tl;dr Health inspection letter grades are too vague and arbitrary to have the so large an impact on a restaurant's ability to compete and survive.

Warning: Mention of emotional/mental abuse. I’m okay with some advice but I will mention I am currently attending therapy. My therapist diagnosed me as a “parental child.” Due to my mothers neglect. I am current NC.

Background: In my other posts on my profile I mention I am currently an Active Duty Military female. I am also married to another ADM member (My Husband). 

Now I always knew there was something wrong with my upbringing, I just didn’t realize the extent until I started dating my husband. At the time we met (We were in training school), I was still paying bills for my mothers home. Of which, when I mentioned it to my husband (to his horror), he gently as possible explained how that was really inappropriate. Right when I stopped paying, (at this time I also received orders for overseas) my mother called me. She called me to let me know the apartment she lives in with my 3 other siblings is going to be foreclosed on. I stuck to my guns and did not give any money (although I ended up amending my orders to be stationed stateside, closer to them in case something did happen). Surprise, surprise, she didn’t lose the house. 

Cue for the next couple of years of dealing with comments of “Your SO is just like your father you should leave him” (For some background my Dad was physical abusive due to anger issues. He has since attended therapy, apologized to me, remarried, had 4 more children and we both have progressed towards a healthy relationship). “You should leave the military, it’s just not you.”/“When are you coming back home?”/“I don’t thinks it’s fair your spending christmas with SO’s family.” /“I know you sweetheart, you will do the right thing and come home.”

I dealt with constant verbal lashing about how I should leave the military, how that since I married someone in the service, I should just use his benefits. That my husband, for the sake of “family togetherness”, should move closer/live close to HER.( For context my husbands family lives in Virginia and she lives in NYC) I always tried to steer the conversation elsewhere, I constantly asked her to respectfully stop of which I was mostly ignored. Every time she would use the same line “I am your mother and I’m only telling you what’s best for you.” Never mind that everyone else is proud of what I accomplished. She always pushed her agenda.

Mind you this behavior only started after I joined the military. Before that, I endured constant threats of being kicked out of the apartment (Of Which she was barely ever home, she was always at a friends or at her on again off again boyfriends house in NJ) I wasn’t contributing enough financially. (She even changed the locks on me when I came home one day) How I was worthless for not doing well enough in college (meanwhile I was expected to help my siblings in school and do my own work) and how I would never find a good man because of how lazy I am.  Meanwhile I paid bills, bought groceries (even though we had food stamps) and cleaned as much I could, working 2 part time jobs (waitressing) and attended full time college (Community College). What infuriates me the most, was finding out my father was still paying child support for me during this time period. Something like $1750 a month.

For those who read up to this point, I always tried to keep peace, but this was the moment that finally made me snap. Now again, if you read some of my prior posts, I share stories about my mentally unstable sister and how my mother would often placate/enable her destructive/abusive behavior. 

It was a normal summer day when I received her call. “Your sister is pregnant.” In the most happy/excited tone in her voice. I was stunned. (When I would mention kids my mother would go on tangents on how she was too young to be a grandma and we are too young to be thinking that way, mind you we brought it up when I was 26y old. )My sister was 21yrs old at the time. I knew she just started dating someone new (They were dating for 2 months at this time)She dropped out of college after one semester. She has been bouncing to and from minimum wage jobs opening credit cards and maxing them out ruining her credit, and from what my younger brother told me, she has been drinking and doing drugs in the apartment when my negligent mother isn’t around. I heard the blood rushing through my brain. I could barely hear, let alone comprehend, what my mother was saying to me. “What?” I replied. She then proceeded to say “Whatever your feeling you need to shut it all down and be supportive of your sister.” 

It’s like it all clicked into place. “No.” I replied. 

“Excuse me?!” She said obviously upset.

“I said no.” I replied. “How are you okay with this? She still lives with you, doesn’t have any aspirations to do anything better with her life. She has been underage drinking for YEARS. She just started dating this guy you have no idea about for 2 months. She was committed at the hospital for 24 hours due to suicidal behavior JUST LAST YEAR and was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She doesn’t take care of herself, or really care about anyone else. And now, you are asking me to support this person. The same person who can’t even give a shit enough for herself, let alone 2 cats, of which one died due to neglect! That I’m supposed to support that person with an infant. No. The only way I would EVER support that infant would be if she signed over all parental rights to myself and my husband after birth.”

I left her speechless. For like 3 seconds. “How dare you! This could be the moment that turns her life around! Becoming a mom changes you. Her boyfriend said he’s gonna do the right thing and marry her! She’s also working at Outback so she has a job! I don’t understand why you hate your sister so much! She told me she’s moving into her boyfriends (mothers) house! You should be happy for her and be willing to do anything to support her!” 

I felt like I had been slapped with a hard dose of reality. See, my mother was pregnant at 18. She had me and married my dad “to do the right thing”. They had a nasty divorce and both my younger brother and I dealt with the animosity/anger/abuse for years. She then remarried another asshole, had 2 more kids, of which the asshat left us HOMELESS. Throughout my life I watched the struggles first hand. And here she was. As If she was proud of my sister following IN HER EXACT FOOTSTEPS. I felt sick. 

I told her her “I need to go.” I hung up. Later that day my uncle called me. He was like an older brother to me and supported me when he could.  He tells me he heard about my sister and how worried he was. (My grandfather told him about it) That she contacted him just the week prior asking for $300 to go to disney world. (She went down to Florida from NYC and demanded the money from my grandparents who reside there, when they didn’t give it to her, she went to my uncle.) He also told me that they were expecting as well (Of which I was excited for them, I know my uncle will be an awesome dad). He calmed me down. It cheered me up.

That night I received a text message “HOW DARE YOU TELL YOUR UNCLE ABOUT YOUR SISTERS PREGNANCY! ( I didn’t) YOUR UNCLE DIDNT SUPPORT ME WHEN I WAS PREGNANT! (Mind you he was 12 when she was pregnant) HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING SO HURTFUL?! I didn’t answer. I was mentally checked out at this point. The next day I got word that my husband and I received orders to Colorado.

I told my family. I then received texts from my sister. Threatening me, and my husband. How my uncle and I made this stuff up because we wanted to take the attention away from her. How she hoped my uncles wife (my awesome aunt) would suffer a miscarriage and I finally catch a haji bullet. (which I work with computers sooo like WTF?) I had enough. I replied back. “You obviously want me gone. So, done. Consider me gone, i am no longer your family goodbye.” I blocked her off everything. I blocked my mother off everything. 

And suddenly it was as if I could breathe. I cried. I told my husband and bless him he held me as he told me, he was here. That I did the right thing. That I don’t owe them anything. The next week there was a package at my door. No return address. When I opened it, I WAS HORRIFIED. It was a dead rat in a ziplock bag. I threw it away before my husband saw it. (I knew he would flip his lid if he did, He was already stressed enough with a job deadline with highvis.) I kept to my guns and remained NC. One of my friends back home (who happened to be friends with my sister on instagram) told me she put up a post saying she lost the baby due to trisomy 13 at 12 weeks. When I spoke to my younger brother, he told me she was still drinking and doing drugs even after she knew she was pregnant. I felt relieved. I PCS’d with my husband and tried to stay NC since. (more on that in different post)

For those who read this far, thank you for reading. This has really helped me vent out my frustration and feelings on the matter. Therapy is also helping with recognizing my emotions and dealing with them properly. Feedback/advice/words of encouragement is welcomed. Thank you for everything!"
88,A Snipe Hunt in the Adirondacks,149,7xnw5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7xnw5v/a_snipe_hunt_in_the_adirondacks/,22,1518667103.0,"Every year, me and my buddy Sam go camping in Adirondack Park in upstate New York. It’s a state park, but it’s huge; bigger than Yellowstone, Everglades, Glacier, and Grand Canyon National Parks combined. If you look at a map at of New York State, you'll see a big ""hump"" at the top: most of that hump is the Adirondacks. The park consists of 6.1 million acres of mountains, lakes and streams, most of it is remote wilderness.

Last summer Sam’s cousin Craig came along with us. Craig’s from NYC and is *extremely* proud of it. We met up with him in Albany, and for the whole long drive up into the mountains we had to listen to him go on and on about how awesome the city is; how everything is always happening there, and about all the cool underground places he goes too. I don’t think he’s ever really been outside of it either. I asked him during the ride what the most exotic place he’d ever been to was. He seemed confused and said: “Well… I been to Jersey once, but it sucked. Everything you could ever need is in city, there’s really no reason to ever leave.” Sam and I looked at each other, rolled our eyes, and kept driving.  

---

As we get further into the mountains the asphalt road eventually changes to dirt and then becomes a tiny old logging road which ends in the middle of the woods. We park the car and from there it’s a 5 mile hike on a tiny path to a place Sam had scouted out on the internet. Craig complains the *entire time* (It’s too hot. Why are there so many bugs? I don’t get any fuckin’ cell reception here!) and me and Sam are just getting more and more pissed off listening to him.

Finally we reach the site and set up camp on the shore of this absolutely gorgeous lake, totally untouched by human civilization. We’re completely alone in the wilderness and Sam and I are loving it, but Craig still won’t shut up. As night falls we build a fire, roast some weenies and drink a few beers to a soundtrack of crickets, frogs, and Craig’s whining.

“So what are we supposed to *do* out here?”

“Nothing, Craig. That’s the point.”

“What do you mean nothing! I’m fuckin’ bored. This place sucks ass. There’s really nothing to do?”

“Just sit back, relax, enjoy the fire, look at the stars, and drink a few beers. C’mon dude, look around you: we're in paradise. Enjoy it.”

“Man I hate this shit. It’s too quiet. I’m bored out of my fucking mind. We should have just stayed in the City at my place. I know this awesome bar in Brooklyn, totally underground, no one knows about it, but like, these big national bands show up sometimes and play these secret sets...”

And on and on and on till I’m ready to bash my brains out. Finally I’ve had enough, and an idea starts to formulate in my mind.

“So, you want something to do Craig?”

“Oh my God yes, pleeeease. Anything would be better than sitting here drinking beers and staring at trees like some fuckin’ hillbillies.”

I look at Sam and raise an eyebrow. “How about a snipe hunt?”

Sam smiles. “Oh yeah, definitely. Snipe hunt for sure.”

“The fuck’s a snipe hunt?” says Craig.

“Oh my God, you’ve never been on a snipe hunt before? Duuude, you’re going to love this. We’re gonna go out into the woods and catch us some snipe.”

“The fuck’s a snipe? I’ve never heard of one.”

“It’s a little furry animal,” Sam chimes in. 

“What, like a raccoon or something?”

“Sort of,” I say. “But not really. They’re just a small furry animal, and they move real fast. They only live around here. The Indians used to hunt em’ back in the day to prove their manhood.”

“But… we don’t have any guns.” says Craig. 

“Don’t need any,” I say. “Only a coward hunts snipe with a gun. A real man hunts em’ like the Indians used to. Don’t worry I’ve got you covered.” I go to the tent and grab a couple flashlights and a big burlap bag, then go to the trees at the edge of the campsite and select a nice, straight fallen branch. I walk back to Craig and hand him the bag, a length of rope, and the branch. He takes them slowly, apprehensively.

“Don’t worry, they’re just little animals. They can’t hurt you.” I say.

“I’m… not so sure about this.”

“Oh, my God you woose! Would you rather stay here staring at trees?”

“Fine,” he says, taking the bag and makeshift club. “Lets do it.” Sam and I light our flashlights and exchange a knowing smile.

---

So I’ll stop here for a second and explain, in case you guys reading this aren’t from the United States (or you are but you’re a city person like Craig.) Snipe aren’t real. It’s a prank played on people who aren’t very experienced in the outdoors. It’s usually done by older Boy Scouts to the younger ones; the kids go crashing through the woods looking for snipe like idiots and it’s hilarious. Of course, we didn’t tell Craig that.

---

The three of walk around the lake until we find a stream, then we follow that for about a mile until we find a clearing on the bank with a big tall oak tree standing by itself. I make a big show of looking all around, testing the wind, etc. “This is it. This is the perfect place to hunt snipe.” I say.

“OK, so what do I do?” 

“It’s easy. You just stand here by the stream with your club and bag ready. Eventually a snipe will come out of the woods over there to get a drink. You stand very still and when he gets close you whack him with the club and throw the bag over him. And that’s it. Simple. Then you can take him home to the city and impress all your super hip friends.” 

Sam stifles a giggle with his hand and I shoot him a look.

“OK, that doesn’t sound too bad,” says Craig. “I can do that.”

“Ok man, good luck,” I say and turn to leave.

“Hold on! You guys aren’t going to stay with me?”

I look at Sam and he says “Ohh well, no. All three of us standing here would scare the snipe away… and we’ve both caught tons of em’ in the past, so now it's your turn.”

“But It’s dark out here! Aren’t you going to leave me one of the flashlights?”

“No can do,” I answer. “Snipe are terrified of light, you turn that thing on and every snipe in a five mile radius will take off. If I leave you a flashlight you’ll be way too tempted to use it and ruin your chances. So we’ll be keeping them, but don’t worry you’ve got the moon and the stars for light, and out here that’s plenty.”

“Well, OK I guess. Where are you guys going to go?”

“We’ll circle back through the woods in the area snipe usually nest, and that’ll push em towards you,” I say.

“I’m not so sure about this anymore guys…”

“Oh come on ya pansie. You walk the mean streets of Harlem and the Bronx and all those places you were telling us about, but you’re afraid of a tiny little snipe. C’mon man! You’re perfectly safe as long as you stay right here, just make sure you don’t go wandering off and get lost, OK?”

“OK fine, just… hurry up. I don’t really like the dark.”

“OK man, goodluck,” I say.

Sam and I walk off down the creek back towards camp, leaving Craig behind alone in the dark clutching his club and burlap sack.

“How long do you think it takes until he notices there’s no moon tonight?” I ask, and we both start cracking up.

---

We sit at the campsite drinking beers and laughing at Craig’s naivety. “Do you think he’ll be OK? I mean, he’s a serious dumbass but my mom will kill me if something happens to him. What if we can’t find him again?” says Sam.

“He’ll be fine as long he listens and stays put. All we have to do is follow the stream back to where that big oak tree is standing, no problem. He’ll get a good scare and maybe he’ll finally shut up for awhile and later we’ll all laugh about it.” We drink beers for about an hour and then decide to head back and get him.

But when we get there, he’s gone. There’s nothing but empty space where left him. “Holy shit,” says Sam and we both start yelling his name and walking up and now the bank of the stream.

“Craig! Craig!! Where’d you go dude? Craig!”

We hear something moving in the bushes and both freeze—It sounds big.

In an explosion of leaves, a large shape springs out at us and we both scream.

“RAAAWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!! AHAHAH!! I got you fuckers!”

It’s Craig.

“Oh man you should have seen the looks on your stupid faces!”

Sam punches him hard in the shoulder. “You stupid bastard, you scared the shit out of us. What were you doing in there?”

“Scaring you dumbasses, that's what. Who’s King of the Jungle now, bitches? ME that’s who! I’m a fuckin’ mountain man! I stayed out here alone in the dark, I caught the snipe, and I scared you fuckers good!”

Wait, what.

“Hold up,” says Sam. “What do you mean you caught the snipe?”

“Yeah, I got him good. He came out the woods just like you said; and he was *movin’* too. Came fuckin’ flyin’ at me. But I whacked him right between the eyes and knocked his ass out. BOOYAH! I AM ALL THAT IS MAN!”

“Dude, there’s no such thing as snipe,” I say.

“What do you mean?”

“It’s made up. Snipes are non-existent. It’s just a way to get you to stand out here in the dark like a dumbass.”

“What the fuck,” says Craig. “You bastards were just messing with me? … what did I catch then?”

Sam and I look at each other. “A muskrat, maybe?” he suggests.

“What’s a muskrat look like?” asks Craig.

“It’s a furry mammal. Looks kind of like a beaver but with a long skinny tail like a rat. They live mostly in the water and on river banks. Sam’s probably right, you must have clubbed a muskrat.""

“Nah, I don’t think so. This thing wasn’t furry; it was hairy. It had this thick curly hair, like chest hair, all over its body. And it ran on two legs.”

“Wait what…?”

“Yeah. It was about two feet tall, like a toddler sort of, and it came sprinting out of the woods at me just like you guys said.”

I looked at Sam in the light from my flashlight. His eyes were wide and his jaw hanging. I must have looked similar because Craig says, “guys… what’s wrong?”

“What did you do with it?” I ask him.

“The snipe? I whacked him with the club and then put him in the bag and tied it off. I waited for a while holding the bag over my shoulder. But he must have woken up because the bag started moving around and the snipe was making all these grunts and screeches and his claws started poking me through the bag. So I tied it up on a branch of the tree over there. Then I heard you idiots coming back along the creek so I found a hiding spot to jump out and scare you.”

“Show us. Show us where you put it.”

He walked us back to the big oak tree we’d been using to mark the spot. There was a bag hanging from the tree, but it was empty. 

“What the hell dude, you were just messing with us?” says Sam.

“No man, I swear to God. He was in there.”

“Yeah right,” says Sam. “I think someone's had a few to many beers. You’re cut off bud,” he says, snickering.

I shine my flashlight on the empty burlap bag and examine it closer, turning it in my hand. On the side facing away from us there's a long slash in the bag from top to halfway down to the bottom. Sam’s eyes get big.

“Oh what the fuck is going on here?”

“See, I told you guys.”

“Craig,” I say trying to sound as calm as possible. “Listen man, I’m sorry we tried to play a joke on you. That was mean, but you got us back. Now no more joking: did you cut a hole in this bag and hang it here?”

“No. I promise I didn’t… what is happening? Why do you look so freaked?”

“Craig, there’s no animal around here that’s hairy and walks on two legs. It’s impossible. Nothing like that exists.” He suddenly looks just as scared as I feel. “Back up you guys, don’t step under the bag.” I go down on one knee and shine the flashlight on the dirt, panning slowly from side to side.

And there it is. It’s a handprint. A tiny handprint in the dirt with only four fingers: a thumb and three small fingers. And next to it, two tiny footprints, each with only four toes. I shine the light out across the dirt and there's another footprint and another and another, in a straight line leading towards the edge of the woods.

“What the fuck…” I whisper and keep looking.

I find something else.

It's a small piece of bone, broken in half. I hold the pieces up in the light. It’s been polished till it gleams white. One half comes to a sharp point, and the other half has been fashioned into a crude handle with tiny scratches like primitive hieroglyphics on it.

It’s a knife. A small knife fashioned from human bone. That must be what was poking Craig in the back through the burlap bag, and it must have broken when whatever was wielding it cut its way out.

“What the actual fuck…”

And suddenly I realize that the crickets and frogs and all the night sounds have stopped. The forest is dead silent. The hair on the back of my neck stands up and I get that feeling, the heavy, uneasy feeling you get when you can tell you’re being watched. 

I stay perfectly still and listen. And though there is no wind, I can hear a quiet rustling in the underbrush, coming from all about us at once. But it’s so quiet… am I just imagining things?

“Umm… hey guys,” says Sam. “I think we should get the fuck out of here.”

And that’s all I needed to hear. The three us turned and sprinted back down the stream as fast as our legs would carry us. We all slept in the car that night with the doors locked, and even though it was a warm summer night, we kept all the windows rolled up. 

At first light we quickly packed up the campsite and headed home.

Or Thanks or Tom Hanks has been Infecting just about just about every “fringe” event of sub-series of conspiracy communities. With all the hoopla surrounding him currently I wanted do dive back a couple years to some of the down right ODD things in connection with Mr Hanks.    


From the top I will mention the various point where Tom or connected parties showed up in the particular research I was doing.     
    
  First big series of hanks sync weaving was to do when I was researching the Mandela effect and the prominent position Hanks has as a Nexus of effects.      
    
  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/7lfka2/an\_exercise\_followed\_by\_examples\_word\_association/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/7lfka2/an_exercise_followed_by_examples_word_association/)    
    
  If you are unfamiliar with the Mandela effect then essentially is a a series of pop culture points that have been altered or a wide collection of people have noticed a change from their memory of a particular specific point.   


Weather or not it is faulty human memory or something else is up for debate but what is not up for debate is the rampant and creative ways the Mandela effects connect to Tom Hanks.     
    
  I made this post as a way of explaining how to play with words and symbolism, ways of looking at things as a puzzle.   


Here is a bit of what that looks like.     


Mandel means Almond, An almond is the Mandorla, Mandelas prisoner number is 46664 but used to be 4664 according to some. Cern is said to be responsible or at least involved in some way and their video “Happy” Has Both Nelson Mandela and 4664 (the occluded Prisoner number) Cerns logo has the 666 theme as well as being Mandela effected as well and the effect added a mandorla. Cern built the WWW or 666 vav vav vav 777/ which is also the Monster energy drink logo. LOGOS changing LOGOS is the WORD and the thing that was with God during creation. The levels of fractal metaphor are stunning to me. Staggeringly beautiful not just in their existence but the fact that conscious minds can behold it.   
    
   Isnt it funny that Jaws (villian) and Jaws(shark) are both to do with The mouth and teeth and the ME involves braces... And that the dolly/jaws scene had them mirror each others smiles, like in snow whites mirror mirror. and that the actress who plays dolly is Blanche Ravelec. Blanche means White/pure. As does Clarice In the Silence of the lions/lamb.... loins fruit of the womb. froot looms loony looms..... the double 00 thing oo like eyes that see.  

  
   Sally fields name is effected, her famous Oscar speech is effected, she costars in forest gump which has curious George as a key element and sally field being the one Tom hanks is quoting, he would then be involved in another ME later on. And sally fields brother works at cern... Tom hank is also Woody and Says “Theirs a Snake in my Boots” which contextually makes no sense and reminds us of the Fields not having a plural.. Another way to look at that is “Boots” could be interpreted as a word.. and the Snake is S s is a snake a snake hissessssss los of ssess lol The s on the end can also denote possession (again more S'es) possession is ownership and ownership is shackling and oppressive. You may also be reminded of Field of Dreams “If you build it THEY/HE will come (who is he?) HE is right in the middle of THEY TY thank you... and back to the start with the fact sally fields acceptance speech was her saying thank you to the academy.  


  
   This may appear to be nonsense or gibberish but if you had the time and knew the things I was referencing then you would be able to see the connections.   


Of Course this is just nothing as it is. But then the universe nods to us this genuine morsel.

  Nov-17-19 was the first traced case of the Corona-virus Covid-19  


This simulation was based on the Coronavirus from Pigs in 2019

Now we are in the year of the RAT. Which is quite heavily intoned with the black plague     
    
  [https://chinesenewyear.net/](https://chinesenewyear.net/)    
    
  The phrase ""black death"" (*mors nigra*) was used in 1350 by Simon de Covino or Couvin, a Belgian astronomer, who wrote the poem ""On the Judgment of the Sun at a Feast of Saturn"" (*De judicio Solis in convivio Saturni*), which attributes the plague to a [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astrology)) of Jupiter and Saturn.    
  Hmm that is indeed interesting as I am aware that there is a Great Conjunction this very year, the year of the Rat.  And the Year of the Coronavirus.  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction)    
    
  This conjunction is taking place on the solstice which is quite significant.   
    
  May-31-2000 was our last great conjunction and can you see how the world is so much different from that point in time. And we can suspect that this point in 2020 is yet another turning point into a “New Normal”  


Note that Dante Alighieri was very involved with astrology and had a penchant for the Great conjunctions in particular. And He was the inspiration of the movie INFERNO with Tom hanks trying to prevent a global outbreak intended to reduce  the population to save the planet.

Here is a point of note. I am browsing this wiki for the first time and I am seeing this nugget.  


Pope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and [Cante dei Gabrielli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cante_dei_Gabrielli) da [Gubbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gubbio)  was appointed [*podestà*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podest%C3%A0) of the city.

Podesta really..... I had no idea this name meant anything, really never looked into it, even though I have an obsession with names and the meanings of said names, I had not sought this.   


Ok I seem to be diving into other trails in this Warren of rabbit holes.     
    
    
  Back too Event 201 and Tom hanks game with Rita Wilson where 6 games in is ahead 201 points.     


[https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201)    


What is this? 6201.................... 6 games 201 points...... bill signed into law the day you and Rita Wilson tested positive for corona virus in Australia with your CORONA typewriter?   
    
  So we have a grand convergence of coincidence. 1 with event 201 coming before HR 6201 is passed and 2 with the rummy game hanks played with his wife referencing said bill.

I searched for Tom hanks and found this post from r/Typewriters and its simply an autographed Typewriter but altogether a nod that Im on the right path.   


OH fuckin Kay I guess this means something   


You may mention above I said my wife came In in and mentioned the Tom hanks Movie splash.

Babaloo Mandel? Baloo and Mandel, for real? Mandel like the Mandel effect and the Mandela effect. And Baloo like the character from the jungle book who is not wearing coconuts as a bra anymore?  


Look up “Baloo Mandela effect” and you'll see what I mean.  


This stood out too me because of course Tom hanks connection too the Mandela effect through notably the Most Mandela effects attributed to his name and works. But I didn't think it was 'Enough” to share here.   


So after seeing Madonna and Tom hanks connected via the Corona Typewriter I googled . “Tom Hanks and Madonna”  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_League\_of\_Their\_Own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_League_of_Their_Own)    


OK so the other film by Babaloo Mandel that stood out as another Tom hanks flick was this movie .   


Im getting long winded and as always there is more left out then I have presented it too you as their really is no way of condensing this so that you acquire the full picture.   


I end with a question?!!!   


What was Madonnas name before she changed it too MADONNA for the purposes of being a star?

Well that's not actually the end because we need to wrap this baby up in swaddling clothes.

Tom hanks wife is Rita Wilson...................... Wilson you say?! Hmmm well the vollyball in CAST AWAY must have been named after her... right????   
    
   In the film, Wilson the [volleyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_(ball)) serves as Chuck Noland's [personifie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personification)d [friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_friend) and only companion during the four years that Noland spends alone on a deserted [island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island). Named after the volleyball's manufacturer, [Wilson Sporting Goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Sporting_Goods), the character was created by screenwriter [William Broyles, Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Broyles,_Jr.) While researching for the film, he consulted with professional survival experts, and then chose to deliberately strand himself for one week on an isolated beach in the [Gulf of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California), to force himself to search for water and food, and obtain his own shelter. During this time, a volleyball washed up on shore. This was the inspiration for the film's inanimate companion. From a screenwriting point of view, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a one-person-only situation    
     
   Here is a prime example of synchronicity that when brought up to someone not exposed to these ideas they would come back at you with “Well its prolly because his wife was named Wilson” and then the door is shut for them they don't have to take on any new ideas or modify there existing foundation of reality.  If you tell anyone a small peculiar fact then they inevitably try and “Solve” what you just told them. They have to organize the new information in a way that doesn't cause uncomfortability or stress. The human brain seems to have an Autonomic response to new information that doesn't jive with the world view that person has built up over the years.    
     
   Mention any Mandela effect and someone will try and come up with a reason to ignore what you are presenting to them. The effects themselves are in such mundane places that it doesn't seem to have much weight to the average Joe.    
     
   It seems like many people fall into the logical fallacy of the “Wisdom of the Crowd” Even if they have no concept of what this is they may still fall into its tenants.    
     
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom\_of\_the\_crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)    
     
   Take any of the biggest conspiracies out there. The moon landing, 9-11, flat earth. The bigger and more wide spanning the conspiracy then the more “Well, if this is real then people would have said something about it” “You couldn't keep a secret that big” “Somebody in my life would have told me if X was True/False.”    
   Have you seen the meme from xfiles with the poster Mulder has saying “I want to believe” with a flying saucer on it. Thats what this is like. But the train goes both ways. “I want” and “I dont want. “    
     
   [https://www.amazon.com/X-Files-Poster-Believe-Official-24x36/dp/B003V1IU3O/ref=asc\_df\_B003V1IU3O/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309733593834&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8924062892720319746&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010924&hvtargid=pla-571329128101&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=61981387152&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=309733593834&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8924062892720319746&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010924&hvtargid=pla-571329128101](https://www.amazon.com/X-Files-Poster-Believe-Official-24x36/dp/B003V1IU3O/ref=asc_df_B003V1IU3O/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309733593834&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8924062892720319746&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010924&hvtargid=pla-571329128101&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=61981387152&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=309733593834&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8924062892720319746&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010924&hvtargid=pla-571329128101)    
     
   Both of these Mantras play out in our heads unbeknownst to our recognition. A duel play on what we wish reality to be and what we wish it not to be. As want and unwant are dualistic sides of the same coin.  For someone that believes 9-11 was an inside job. “I want to believe” that I among all these other people on this planet found out that this large sector of society has been duped and I am one of the few people smart enough to have figured it out.    
     
   For someone who thinks 9-11 conspiracy theorists are insane. “ I dont want to believe I have been duped by the establishment and that everything I have been taught and all the people that I love have been duped into believing an untruth.”    
     
   I think this is mainly something that stems from our human need for others to identify with and a tribe to call home. And to have our beliefs echoed by another group. To be acknowledged as a contributor to the paradigm and to feel validated by others that feel the same way.    
     
   Its like we are innately narcissistic creatures who love our own images. We find those most similar to us and we just stare at each other reflecting the same ideas and producing a greater dived between US and THEM.What it comes down to is life's great mystery. Which takes shape in questions we ask ourselves:  ” Why do I exist?” “Why is reality a thing instead of a non-thing?” “What is my purpose?”    
     
   Instead of “what is my purpose?” it becomes “Is there even a purpose?”    
     
   Mainstream elements give us Relativity, The Big Bang, and Evolution.    
     
   If a human delves into and absorbs these tenants of culture, then one may come to the conclusion that reality is the result of a freak accident of random number of infinite forces coming together and creating everything you know and love and think and do. That it is all a fluke and you are just lucky..... but luck doesn't exist because this is a random universe and nothing lies deeper than surface exploration.    
     
   To identify Self you must also have the Other. The contrast creates the existence of a thing.Imagine 2 worlds, one of infinite shadow and one of infinite light. The one of infinite shadow would be a black slate and the world of light a white slate. Without contrast everything is nothing. Sense without the lack of sense is Nonsense. A world of pure sound or silence is a world where sound isn't a thing that exists.  If you ask the question. “What is a thing” the answer would be the inverse of its opposite. What is an exhale. It is the inverse of an inhale. But what is that? It is a see saw..... seeing and after seeing sawing. SAW because it WAS. Its like pIng pOng In and Out IO overlapped is the symbol for power. On/Off.  Imagine a hero without a villain. The story of Batman is a prime example of the balancing force of the universe. Without the Joker he would have never experienced the trauma to become the batman, its very possible that if the joker had not killed his parents that he would not have had fear in the cave with the bats. Joker was the primeval creation force alchemizing the batman into existence.    
     
   And then you ask would the Joker have done what he did if he didn't have a nemesis to combat against... a force to emphasize his existence    
     
   This reality/ game seems like a puzzle of disCERNment. That the presence of so many untruths shows us the massive amounts of truths that can be yielded. The shadows can show us where the light lies.

I see this when I go to CNN today to see that Tom and Rite are at home safe and sound.   


Why does she make a video holding a book that she is not reading and making sure to show the title in the scene.   
    
Enders Game, Or is it the End Game of the end times ala Thanos Snap reducing the worlds population.  


I read this book in high-school.

Im sure more people are saying whats dat book she readin in dere.   
    
    
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s\_Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game)   


The book is a story of a dystopian future where children are raised on video games and are chosen based on their aptitude to be brought into the military and as a part of their training they do a series of “Wargames”  via simulations systems and Haptic feedback suits for realism. SPOILER ALERT! The simulations they were performing were actual drone battle missions where they were killing actual sentient creatures.     


The psychology of getting kids to perform against actual foes with the knowledge that it was all a game made them more proficient in their duty to kill.    


Ok lets reel it back for a     
    
  TLDR.   
    
  Tom hanks is involved or a focal point in the Mandela effect phenomenon present in Forrest Gump Life is/.was like a box of chocolates, Apollo 13 Houston we have/we've had a problem, Woody from toy story says “There's a snake in my boot/s ,Momma from Forrest Gump is played by sally field/s whose name is considered a Mandela effect and has a famous Oscar speech that is commonly attributed to the Mandela effect and Sally Fields brother in real life is a scientist at CERN. CERN  makes a video set too Pharrells Happy that is filmed at Cern and a scientist holds up signs saying Bond# (Barry Nelson) and Mandela underneath, also showing the number 4664     
    
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46664](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46664)    
    
  Tom hanks then turns CERN back on after a failure that had occurred. He did this in honor of a movie Angels and Demons whos sequel INFERNO has Hanks catch a virus set to be a worldwide pandemic for the purposes of population control for the greater good. In Nov of 2019 one month before the first documented case of Novel Coronavirus Event 201 is hosted in  NYC by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. And on 3-11-2020 the same day Hanks and Rita announce they are infected with Corona virus, after bringing a Corona typewriter all the way to Australia. Then Hanks announces his wife's score of 6 games 201 points. When 6201 if you google it will get you one thing.  


[https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201)   


Hanks is called out in a video also calling out Epstein and others involved in the underground trafficking of children, This person is then killed/died/epstiened on route 66 which Tom hanks Tweets about.   


There is some funky stuff going on in the world and to be blunt there are 3 options. And then variations between those 3 options.   
    
  The extremes are   


1. This is all orchestrated and everything presented through the public is controlled/filtered and dispensed with one purpose. All news media and things that people talk about are intricately put together to share some underlying puzzle.  


Ways this could be feasible: this is a simulation and everything is preordained and put in place with no free will to the occupants in the simulation.   


Ways it couldn't be feasible. Barring a simulation it just would not cut it to have any sort of person or group in charge of such a thing, its too well orchestrated for human hands.   


I suppose a god of the realm in control of such things could perform such a feat..... but why?  


2. This is all the universe playing a coincidence game, a red herring game of sorts to keep some busy and others asleep.  Like if Tom hanks really got the itch to bring his Corona typewriter and he and his wife did actually play games of Gin Rummy that resulted in the 6 games 201 points with Event 201 being finished and HR 6201 just passing the same day they are infected with coronavirus.   


This is just one facet of the coincidental underlying tapestry that paints itself underneath human activity.   


Within this post I detail some stellar findings/coincidences that bear repeating here.

What are the odds that 666. Nautical miles =1234.56432 Kilometers ? You have the sequential united with the repetitive number sequences married by a relationship between the size of the earth and the speed of light.

What are the odds that Wilson the volleyball is not named after Rita Wilson, his wife who kept her last name. But is instead named because the Writer stranded himself on an island and a Wilson Volleyball washed up onshore. This is the type of coincidence that bars any human forethought or knowledge to arranging. One of those universal winks in the form of syncs.   
    
    
  Look for my post history and you will find hundreds of WTF how is this a coincidence facts that could be both coincidence/divine providence/ or the will of man.  


Oh yeah and the 3rd Extreme way of looking at this data I have presented here and in the past is to just shut the door and say.  


“Nothing” none of this means anything at all and you are just thinking too much or looking too deep.   


The most likely is a synergy of these 3 points. There maybe a controlling organization or AI program controlling the media and news, film and music.  But there is most likely a clever universal side of things projecting the ironic in these peculiar times. And im sure some of this is just digging to deep as everything is intrinsically connected .   


What cant be stated is the data presented is incorrect(unless it is,im not perfect) it is our interpretation of the data that differs, im not making any conclusions, im only discussing options and possibilities."

Hello, reddit! This is a very long post, but I hope it’s worth the reading. Sorry.

I am Nana, and today I bring you a fan-theory on the meaning behind MyChem's symbols presented to us in the occasion of the band's return announcement and later on, at the actual reunion concert day.

**First Considerations:**

**1.** being it, as the title implies, a fan-theory, I do not claim any of the exposed to be factual when associated to MCR. I bring this thread to you guys in hopes that we can discuss, expand, teach and learn with each other, and maybe come to some sort of conclusion. Riddles are fun to play, especially together. I love riddles in fandom experience. :)

**2.** I highly apologize for my limited vocabulary and weird phrasing. I am not a native english speaker, but I'll try my best to make this understandable to everyone;

**3.** Despite my personal beliefs and stupid jokes, I mean no disrespect to any religion or symbol mentioned in here. (just as much as I believe MyChem also doesn't, on the wild possibility of this thread being on point with what they planned, lol).

That being said, before we start, I have some thanks to give:

this theory was only put together thanks to my lovely mychem group chat, composed by Raffs, Clara, Caroline and Hana ( ([/u/lesbiero](https://www.reddit.com/u/lesbiero/)). thanks for all the time and effort we shared, and for holding my brain with your bare hands when it was about to melt, friends.

Also thanks to Frank Iero himself, for laughing at me on twitter for me not being able to understand the reunion clues, despite ""wearing a California 2019 shirt for 6 years"". I humbly accept the possibility of this theory having nothing to do with the truth, but I sure hope I can laugh back at you in the end, rat. I love you.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's finally head to The Archangel Theory, or, as I like to call it, The “If We're Not Careful We'll Turn Into Catholics” Theory, and how it all started.

It was Halloween. Everyone here was minding their own damn business (I was being a clown on twitter, Hana was putting on her badass revenge-themed makeup. You know, the usual). And we all know what happened: MCR raised gracefully from the dead, dropping brand new symbolism and a stunning angel image to our poor panicked hearts. A few days later, when Hana’s crying ruined makeup was long gone and everyone calmed the F down a little bit, people started to ask themselves: okay, cool, but *what does it mean?*

Like many of you, the first thought that crossed my mind was tarot. Because, well, how f-ing cool would it be, right? I draw tarot everyday. I just loved the idea. Mychem posting a latin countdown with some eerie photo was just… yea, I was very excited with this.

Many of us also associated the symbols with past albums and even with the members themselves. All of these theories are very valid to me, and I loved reading them. I agree with many points raised.

Well, everything was fine (as fine as it could be, because I am so damn curious). The Return concert happened at the faithful date of December 20, California. We all freaked out and enjoyed the noble services’ of  days\_fate and diet\_shampoo’s streaming. All that jazz.

But then: well… another angel. I started to think to myself: is this a pattern? The show ends, we get very emotional, everything is okay (i hate this pun) with the world. Frank Iero makes a post-concert post on instagram, talking about how everything was pure Magick. With a K.

For those unfamiliar, this is an occultist term related to Aleister Crowley’s Thelema, to differentiate the religious concept from the “stage magic” that we are used to. A very carefully picked name that I highly doubt someone would drop around without knowing what it implies.... Don’t even start me with the K and C keys being so damn far away from each other on a keyboard.

At this point me and my groupchat were starting to be very done with Frank’s clownery (we indeed love him very much for that), and so we started to hurt our minds every single day since then. that’s the result:

**THE ARCHANGEL THEORY**

Let’s Return™ to the basics: angels and, probably, tarot.

Funny enough, there are actually angels in tarot cards. There are many types of decks, but for this we are using the most famous one, which most people believe holds ancient symbolism, The Rider-Waite Tarot.

There are many angels and archangels mentioned in the Bible (only a few by name, tho), but only four of them made it into being represented in tarot cards: Uriel, Michael, Gabriel and Raphael. Let’s get the gang together and meet the holy crew (please, forgive me for the puns).

* **Uriel,** whose name means “the light of god”, “the flame of god”. It’s the Wise Angel, often pictured as the one who holds books and scrolls and bears holy knowledge and understanding. or **Clarity**, if you will. They’re sort of the goth one™, associated with the Tartarus and being pictured as pitiless as any demon would; even holding the key to Hell during the end of times, Uriel is described as the angel who watches “over thunder and terror”. Uriel is sometimes even mistaken for a demon (apparently, the eastern catholicism accepts Uriel identity as an archangel, while the western catholicism gives more credit to its dark side, and does not encourage worshiping); this duality comes from the notion that very often, enlightenment may be the end result of dark times. Every archangel has many, I said MANY symbols attached to them, so other elements associated with this angel can be found on the image attached to this post.

**About Uriel’s Tarot Card:** if you were raised in a catholic family and slept through as much catechism as I did as a kid, maybe you’ll be surprised to know that Lucifer, Satan and Uriel are all different beings. Let it be a lesson: no matter how edgy of a teen you are, please accept knowledge from any possible source. Putting this thread together would’ve been so easier to me now if I did, haha... That being said, our angel Uriel is actually the Devil in the Devil Tarot card, which meaning touches on addiction, obsession, feeling imprisoned or restrained, but it being only an illusion of powerlessness. This card is an invitation to free yourself, fight distractions and temptation, and finally fulfill your destiny. Please, consider that tarot readings are very deep and variable; there’s extensive books only on tarot meaning, so I won’t explore much on each card. that’s just a very general notion.

Some sources also consider Uriel to be the responsible for the change represented in the Death card, despite not being directly pictured in such card. As stated before, Uriel is associated with the concept Death brings, being a turning point, and ending route.

**The symbolism presented in the Devil card** (as for the Rider-Waiter deck):

“At the foot of the Devil stand a man and a woman, both naked and chained to the podium on which the Devil sits. They appear to be held here against their will – but look closer, and you will notice that the chains around their necks are loose and could be easily removed. Each has small horns on their head, like the devil’s, a sign that they are becoming increasingly like him the longer they stay here. Both have tails, a further symbol of their animalistic tendencies and raw instincts, and the grapes and the fire on their respective tails signify pleasure and lust.”

Poor people. If only they knew better. A lil bit of Clarity, huh?

That’s it for MCR’s clarity symbol, conveniently shaped as a candle.

* **Michael,** whose name means “who is like god” (being it a rhetorical question, to mean that no one equals to God). It’s the Protector Angel. They’re the leader of angels in the battle against demons, Defender of God’s realm against Satan in the Book of Revelation. Michael is a warrior, and is often seem with the sword in hand, to allure to the idea of bravery. They’re described as the angel of strength, protection and **Courage.**

**About Michael’s Tarot Card:** Michael appears on the major arcana Temperance.

In fact, even the name “Temperance” comes from the process of refining and strengthening materials in metallurgy. this one likes swords a lot, huh. That’s a card which meaning touches on patience and prudence. It means already having a clear vision and knowing what you want to achieve. Now It’s all about thinking before action, and accepting the balance of things, blending the opposites to achieve an ideal solution. Apparently a very suited card for a warrior of faith. Prepare yourself: in my research, I’ve found a source that associates this card with the color blue (the very same of the archangel) and the musical note G. Yes, the universe has a strange sense of humor.

\*\*The symbolism presented in the Temperance card: “\*\*The vessels in the angel’s hands represent the vessel that contains eternal life. The flowers are Irises symbolising the goddess Iris who links God to humanity. Iris travels from one end of the world to another, into the depth of the sea and the underworld. The angel’s feet, one on land and one in water, symbolise the unification of the external and internal, conscious and subconscious. It also represents testing the waters before jumping into the unknown. The red wings on the angel represent blood which symbolizes life. The sun conceals a crown which represents a connection to higher power. The triangle on the angel’s dress is an equilateral triangle and symbolise spirit, divinity, fire, life, prosperity, and harmony. It can also symbolise God and the holy trinity. The square outside the triangle represents protection and stability.”

The MCR symbol for Courage is a drop. is it a drop of blood? for an warrior angel and their endless battles on God’s behalf? Of water, the waters of unknown? The water of balance of life? I don’t know.

When Michael / was a young genderless being,/ their father…

* **Gabriel:** whose name means “strength of god”. It’s the Messenger Angel; Gabriel is often portrayed playing the trumpet, to make announcements of God’s will. (many angels play the trumpets on Revelations book,, but Gabriel seems to be the most intimately attached to this concept). In the hierarchy of angels, Gabriel seems to occupy a very high position, being knows as the “Left Hand of God” (our Michael aforementioned being the Right-hand angel).

Their famous appearances on the Bible includes appearing to Zechariah and the Virgin Mary, foretelling the births of John the Baptist and Jesus. Islam also has Gabriel appearing for many prophets, telling them the divine plans. In a way, all those messages are basically callings to a higher purpose, a proof of faith, a personal **Sacrifice.** This idea is reiterated by the symbolism of Gabriel’s tarot card.

Gabriel is also one of the Angels of Death (depending on the religious we are speaking about, there are over 14 different angels with this role). Not in a dark way, their role is to comfort and bring peace to the deceased, guiding them into the light. Gabriel is therefore an angel of mercy, redemption achieved through a proof of faith (often a self-sacrifice, of  any nature), after a fair judgement. speaking of which…

**About Gabriel’s tarot card:** Gabriel appears on the major arcana Judgement, which meaning touches on taking responsibility for your actions, speaking the truth. It’s a beginning/ending type of card, but a different kind of change than the one represented on one of Uriel’s card, Death. While Death brings something unstoppable, more powerful than anyone’s options, Judgement usually portraits something you can actually choose to take part in. But it also your responsibility any consequences of not taking this step. A fair judgement, indeed.

**The Symbolism presented in the Judgement card:** “The angel with the Trumpet could be a reference to the angels and the seven trumpets in Revelation, bringing apocalypse and resurrection. The white banner with the red cross can be St. George Flag, and a reference to Saint George gives Judgement the symbolism of sacrifice done in the name of our faith. Both the flag and the trumpet are military symbols of authority. A man, a woman and a child are being called from the tomb of ego consciousness. The three people are reflected on the other side of the river, another symbol of the soul’s victory over death. The three people are also a symbol of the three pillars of the tree of life. The man and the woman has changed side from the familiar feminine on the left and masculine on the right. In Judgement it is the other way around. Perhaps it is to unify us and to tell us to look at a situation from a different perspective, from within. You are seeing the pillars from the Angel’s perspective. This symbolises to raise your thinking and ask for Divine Perspective. The mountains represent the structure that surrounds us all.”

Calling all units! Time for the ultimate vibe check.

I guess that’s it for our third MCR symbol, Sacrifice, shaped as hand. Is it a left hand, just like one of Gabriel’s titles? that would be interesting.

But not so fast.

Now we come to an interesting point. Gabriel is the first of our angels to have a sculpture used by My Chem. :) It’s actually endearing how, if this assumption is correct, they chose the messenger archangel to bring the good news: mcr is alive!

**About Gabriel’s sculpture:** our Return angel, as some of us already know by this point, is actually a piece called “Angelo e Alma”, by italian artist Pasquale Rizzoli. It is located on Cella Magnani, a memorial chapel of the Magnani family, inside Certosa di Bologna, which is a very antique monastery, later transformed on a monumental cemetery for many italian families. You can take a look[ here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpkikH9lUyM), it’s stunningly beautiful.

Finished in 1906, this piece was a commission by the widow of a war veteran called Natale Magnani, who apparently died young. As far as I understand written italian, since I speak portuguese (latin languages perks, yey!), it’s still difficult to me to do further research on this family. Being it an old, traditional italian family, there’s tons of Magnanis, but there’s little to no info on Natale or his wife’s lives on the internet, it seems. If you’re italian and have any info about this, please comment. It can actually be relevant to this thread.

This sculpture portraits an angel ascending to heavens, guiding a soul (represented as a woman in a long dress). There’s rose branches and lilies at the feet of both the angel and the soul, as they fly together. These flowers pay homage to Magnani’s family blazon, as stated by the Storia i Memoria di Bologna Project website, that also offers on their site a brief explanation on the meaning behind the many other plants on this piece. they all basically allure to death, sleep, and resurrection. you can check it out [here](https://www.storiaememoriadibologna.it/cella-magnani-1040-opera).

The presented symbolism, being an angel appearing to a soul in their travel to the spiritual realm, and even the flowers used, lead me to conclude that this sculpture very likely pictures our Archangel Gabriel, in their judgement roles again.

Now, our holy rpg party already has a mage, a paladin and a bard. It’s time to introduce the most underappreciated (and my personal favorite) class:

* **Raphael**: whose name means “God heals”. Raphael is the angel for healing, thus making ‘whole’ everything that has been broken. They’re also a patron for lovers, role that he plays by using his healing powers in a non-literal way. Pay attention to the “fixing the broken and making it a whole again” part, that’s the connotation.

Both of these titles come from the roles Raphael played, depicted on the scriptures: the most famous ones being when Raphael was sent by the Lord to heal Tobit of his blindness and to deliver Sarah, his future daughter-in-law, from the demon Asmodeus, who killed every man she married on their wedding night before the marriage could be consummated.

Another famous role commonly related to Raphael is about the Pool of Bethesda. Despite not being mentioned by name, manuscripts of John 5:1–4 describe an angel that blessed this pool, healing the illness of those who touched its waters:

""an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay under"". It’s usually given credit to Raphael for this action, since they’re seem using healing power to fulfill God’s will in many occasions through the Bible.

**About Raphael’s Tarot card**: Raphael appears on the major arcana The Lovers, as the angel blessing the couple depicted. This is a card about romantic, even sexual, attraction, but not purely that. It’s about finding peace within yourself, and in someone else, about the journey to pick “the one” for you. Making a whole out of two halves is a common concept associated with this card.

\*\*Symbolism presented on The Lovers card: “\*\*the man and the woman in the image are being protected and blessed by an angel above. The couple seems secure and happy in their home, which appears to be the Garden of Eden. The fruit tree with the snake behind the woman is a reference to that story, which tells of humanity's fall into temptation and into the realm of flesh and sensuality. The angel depicted here is Raphael, the angel of air - who is of the same element of the zodiac sign that governs this card: Gemini. Air is associated with mental activity, and communication in particular, which is the foundation for healthy relationships. His blessing seems to give this card a sense of balance and harmony, the symbolization of union in a grand and cosmic sense between two opposing forces.”

Another source adds: “The couple stands in a beautiful, fertile landscape, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden. Behind the woman stands a tall apple tree, with a snake winding its way up the trunk. The serpent and apple tree represent the temptation of sensual pleasures that may take one’s focus away from the Divine. Behind the man is a tree of flames, which represent passion, the primary concern of the man. The twelve flames suggest the twelve zodiac signs, the symbol of time and eternity. The man looks to the woman, who watches the angel, showing the path of the conscious to the subconscious to the super-conscious, or from physical desire to emotional needs to spiritual concerns. The volcanic mountain in the background is rather phallic and represents the eruption of passion that happens when man and woman meet in full frontal nudity.”

Despite the latter being a bit too horny for my tastes, lol, both descriptions reiterate Raphael’s influence on the role of patronizing health and union, a journey of **Devotion**.

Oh, about the MCR symbol, shaped as a half-sun. at first I couldn’t find a correlation to Raphael and this sun shape, as for the first three angels it was very clear to me since just as I started reading about them. Then I realized the huge sun portrayed on The Lovers card, behind Raphael.

Despite holding its individual meanings, Tarot cards are not meant to me taken isolatedly. (that’s one of the reasons many people are not found of the single card yes-or-no type of drawing). That being said, it is not a surprised to find traces of one card on another, and many shared symbolism. As for the sun, it appears multiple times on the Rider-Waite deck, but only one card holds the same exact half shaped, upside down, centered sun as the MCR symbol. and that’s The Lovers. :)

Now, our romantic archangel lead us to a very lovely part:

**About Raphael’s Sculpture:** as we waited for MCR to dramatically drop the curtain at the reunion show, we were being watched over by a piece nicknamed “Angel of the Waters,” from the Bethesda Fountain (have you heard this name before?), located in the Bethesda Terrace, Central Park, in NYC. sculpted by Emma Stebbins in 1864, this piece’s history, together with Central Park’s history can be fully read in this awesome article that my friend Clara found: [here.](https://ny.curbed.com/2014/7/16/10074022/unraveling-the-history-of-central-parks-bethesda-fountain)

But since we’re already here, let’s try to make a shorter version, focusing on what’s relevant to this thread.

Upon release, the angel, which stands and above and blesses a water fountain, was directly associated with the Bethesda Pool mentioned in the Bible, and the healing acts of Raphael. On the dedication pamphlet it was quoted the very same passage from the Gospel of John, chapter 5, verses 2-4 I’ve mentioned before. It’s a shame I couldn’t find any pictures of this pamphlet on the internet. Old documents, huh. NY people, if you have access to this, I’d love to see it.

If we stopped there, it would be enough evidence to assume the connection to Raphael, but there’s more! There’s some particularities about this statue.

Its conception was a huge deal: Emma was the first woman to receive a major sculptural commission in New York City. Also, she had a female lover, the world-famous American actress Charlotte Cushman, who, for Cedar Miller, historian that wrote about Central Park and Emma’s statue, holds a huge impact on the Angel of Waters actually making into existence. In 1869, Cushman was diagnosed with breast cancer. In addition to having two mastectomies, Cushman tried water cures in England. (Water cures were a big craze from the 1830s through the 1860s). The historian who wrote about them finds it another connection to the statue itself. Unfortunately, Cushman's treatments were ultimately unsuccessful, she passed away in 1875. Emma followed her not long after, in 1882. To this day, the statue remains, and to NY is a gathering place to find tranquility, peace of mind, even in the darkest times through the its 141 years of existence. It’s a place to heal yourself.

It’s not your average Raphael statue.

We have the archangel connection, a devoted couple's backstory, and lesbian/sapphics rights. I don’t know about you, but I can even picture Gerard Way carefully picking this himself, haha.

Oh, a spicy fact I’ve learned while writing this: This angel sculpture is actually even older in MCR’s history, tracing back to revenge era merch. (I didn’t have much access to mcr merch back in the day so I didn’t know about this, I apologize!)

I guess someone got nostalgic for some catholic aesthetics, huh. Bless!

**Angels in tarot, bonus addition:**

It is valid to mention that not only all of the 4 mentioned archangels have their individual cards, they also appear together in a single card, The Wheel of Fortune. In this card, each angel can be seen in a corner: Raphael (Aquarius) is upper left, Gabriel (Scorpio) is the eagle, Michael (Leo) is the lion, and Uriel (Taurus) is the bull, appearing in disguise, a common thing for angels though the scriptures, it seems.

If you draw tarot, you understand how big of a deal it is. If you’re not familiar, here’s the basic notion: “The wheel of fortune is a card about cyclical change. The wheel keeps on rolling, churning events in a ceaseless progression of ups and downs, either way freeing us from the past. No one can escape its cyclical action, which can feel somewhat terrifying -- no matter whether we are rising or falling. When one is balanced on top of the wheel, there is a moment of crystal clarity. However, the only part of the wheel that's actually not going up and down is the hub, which represents your eternal self. Every one of us will occupy all the points on the wheel at one point or another. The cycle of the wheel is its lesson -- and we can learn to take comfort in it. If you don't like the look of things right now, just wait -- things will change. Of course, if you do like the look of things right now, enjoy it while it lasts, because that will change too!”

It is quite a powerful card that holds all of the aforementioned symbolism. Woa.

**More symbolism seem on this card includes:**

“The Wheel of Fortune card shows a giant wheel, with three figures on the outer edges. Four Hebrew letters – YHVH (Yod Heh Vau Heh), the unpronounceable name of God – are inscribed on the wheel’s face. There are also the letters TORA, thought to be a version of the word Torah, meaning ‘law’, or TAROT, or even ROTA (Latin for ‘wheel’). The middle wheel has the alchemical symbols for mercury, sulphur, water and salt – the building blocks of life and the four elements – and represents formative power. On the outer circle is a snake, the Egyptian god Typhon (the god of evil), descending on the left side. The snake also represents the life force plunging into the material world. On the right side rises the Anubis, the Egyptian God of the dead who welcomes souls to the underworld. And on top of the wheel sits the Sphinx, representing knowledge and strength.”

**THE SECOND SET OF SYMBOLS - STILL A MYSTERY**

So, after all this, if any of this is correct at all, we just learned the meaning behind the first four MCR symbols, released on halloween: Clarity, Courage, Sacrifice and Devotion.

Now, what about the ones released at the reunion show, on the merch truck? Well, my friends, we still have a lot to think about.

I am a doctor, and in my profession there’s a saying which instruct us to always think of what seems like a complicated situation, with many possibilities, as a single disease causing many effects. That was my train of thought as I tried to associate these new symbols with the Archangels that we already have. It may have nothing to do with that at all, but it’s worth trying.

Differently from the first set, the second set didn’t get an official release, and does not hold text captions to guide us on it’s meaning. the symbol shapes, however, are easier to associate with tarot cards than the first ones, in my opinion. I’ve seen people online trying to guess it too.

Having the angels and their aforementioned traits as a guiding line, I used some symbolism associated to each one to connect them to a new symbol, as you can see on the picture attached to this post.

I have some major problems with this, tho, the biggest one being the order of the symbols not matching the first set sequence. We had Uriel (Clarity) / Michael (Courage) / Gabriel (Sacrifice) and Raphael (Devotion). The second set order was Sword / Moon / Tower / Wand, so the sequence goes like Michael  / Gabriel / Uriel / Raphael. It doesn’t match. Please, help me.

**THING THAT KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT: ABOUT WITCHCRAFT AND… SOLDIERS?**

During the past weeks of my life I’ve been researching all types of things to break this down, so I came across some very unsettling things that may be just wild coincidences or... something else? Just in case, I am putting them here in case anyone finds some connection that I couldn’t.

1. **Sigils and Pagan influences, maybe?**

As some people on twitter and reddit noticed, Gerard was using a sigil on his arm that reads “My Chemical Romance”. Every Archangel mentioned here also holds its own sigil, which is shown on the picture attached to this post. While I was excited about the dates for new concerts, I started to think, is there anything special about these dates? I tried to not overthink it because we probably have major influences of disponibilities and,,, Label issues...I don’t know? some very practical stuff going on. But still, I came across an interesting match.

There’s 8 sabbaths, composing the Wheel of the Year, “an annual cycle of seasonal festivals, observed by many modern pagans, consisting of the year's chief solar events (solstices and equinoxes) and the midpoints between them.”

eight sabbaths, eight symbols, huh. Initially, I tried to connect each symbol to a sabbath, but it was very… not satisfying enough to me, so I’m leaving that out; nonetheless, I still believe they hold some meaning similarities.

And it doesn’t stop there.

That our lovely wheel of the year: [here](https://www.13moons.com/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/82fa1d9d6e24ae87ec1eac56b72be63f/w/h/wheelyearcloth.jpg). We’re using a northern hemisphere version, since MCR is based in the USA.

* **The band returned on Halloween, which is the Samhain that occurs between Oct 31 / Nov 1. There’s some minor variation on dates because the Celtic day begins and ends at sunset.**
* **Return Show took place in California, Dec 20: which marks the start of Yule. (Yule dates range from Dec 19 to Dec 22, for the Celtic calendar reasons)**
* **The next sabbath is Imbolt, that takes place on Feb 1 / Feb 2. MCR has nothing announced for this date until now.**
* **2020 concerts will happen during the week of March 20, 21, 25, 28 and 29, In Australia, New Zealand and Japan, as for now. That marks the start of the Ostara sabbath, which start range is March 20/21.**

so… can we expect something (anything?) being announced at Feb 1 or 2, or near that? What about all the remaining sabbaths? Is that a reach? is it related at all? oof.

&#x200B;

* **Who said Danger Days isn’t goth enough?**

Another VERY interesting thing my group chat found on the internet during our MCR tarot obsession. If this theory is correct, this is not the first time they would be alluring to it. Please look at [this pic of Grace Jeanette, The Girl in DD universe, posing with the mailbox on the set of the “Art Is The Weapon”/“Na Na Na” video shoot (2010). (Exact source and photographer unknown; likely taken by Jeanette’s mother).](https://66.media.tumblr.com/426cee9ea4eaceeb4cd6029ace918084/tumblr_pkpowoUyXi1utzmbgo1_540.jpg) (big thanks to tumblr user killjoyhistory).

Bellow the big “OH HELL” we have four tarot cards, on the very same deck we used for this thread, the Rider-Waite deck. The cards are The Tower, The Devil, Death and Three of Wands.

Please note that it may have no correlation to future works, since DD itself had religious symbolism with the Phoenix Witch and this mailbox (go read the comics if you didn’t already. DD rights!), it may be a DD-only thing. Also, please note that 3 out 4 of theses cards were already mentioned in this thread, all possibly related to archangel Uriel.

&#x200B;

* **To wage this war against your faith in me, MCRMY.**

So. This one will sound weird and maybe a reach too, but, hey, mychem is alive and breathing, I guess there’s nothing really impossible, haha….?

Are we all familiar with Gerard liking a lot that green coat? After all those years, I guess so.

Indeed, our lovely frontman used yet another green jacket as his return outfit. This time, it was a military one. As a foreigner, and being very ignorant on how the US Army works, I got curious about the badge on his jacket. Maybe that’s common sense to you guys and I’m just embarrassing myself, but hey! be kind to someone who’s sort of dying inside after all this thinking process, would you?

The badge on Gerard’s jacket happens to be from the 1st Armored Division, a.k.a the Old Ironsides, named after an old ship (and the world's oldest commissioned naval vessel still afloat).

Actually, the nickname “Old Ironsides” trace back to England in 17th century, during their Civil War, but I didn’t find many relevant content / possible connections, besides them being mostly Protestant, in terms of religion… referring to them after all this catholic-conception angel talk is some sort of metaphorical war going on, MCR? Who knows. History-loving english folks, I’m counting on you too now to confirm this, lmao!

The American side of the “Old Ironsides” term, after being passed down from England during their Independence Wars (please be kind with me, my knowledge about american independence is almost 100% from Hamilton the musical lmao, help me) apparently resides, mostly on the US Army/Navy.

Interesting coincidences (?) about this: the Old Ironside ship, aka USS Constitution, has a familiar date on its history: November 1. I’m quoting its construction period info: “Her keel was laid down on 1 November 1794 at Edmund Hartt's shipyard in Boston, Massachusetts under the supervision of Captain Samuel Nicholson and master shipwright Colonel George Claghorn.”

I didn’t read much about it since I’m already at edge with everything I’ve been researching but, it seems it was a very adored ship. In fact, one of the reasons it’s still in active service it’s because a poet even made it a famous poem about this ship, that you can read [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Ironsides_(poem)) It’s symbolic and adored, it seems.

About the homonymous 1st Armored Division of the US Army, which badge Gerard used during the return show: being the first armored division of the U.S. Army to see battle in World War II, it also holds a huge historical meaning.

Again, I don’t have much info to share about this and I think some of you will find possible connections on this better than I would.

But wtf does it have to do with all the angels, Nana?

Well, as mentioned before, angels fight battles in the name of God. They’re heaven’s military. Michael, especially, is a warrior angel and leads God’s troupes against the demons.

Something interesting I’ve found relating Gabriel (which statue, let’s not forget, was commissioned by a war widow) to the war concept was the hebrew poem ""Elifelet"" (אליפלט) written by Nathan Alterman in 1958, often turned into music and played on the israeli radio. it tells of a heroic, self-sacrificing (hm…) israeli soldier being killed in battle. Upon the protagonist's death, the angel Gabriel descends to Earth, in order to comfort the spirit of the fallen hero and take him up to Heaven. It’s very touching, and you can read it [here.](https://ellisacks.wordpress.com/2014/05/07/elifelet-%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%98/)

I’m not saying any particular work like this poem is relevant to MCR’s possible new concept. (let’s not be political here, but also be honest: Israel wars are a delicate matter to bring up). We’re solely working with symbolism and history. Please keep that in mind.

MCR has touched on war thematics before in many occasions (I will not mention all of them, as I believe that as a fandom, we’re aware of that, and we can help new fans to understand it if needed. This text is already TOO LONG). Maybe it’s time for them to talk about some conflicts again, literal or metaphorical? Let’s wait and see.

Oh, one last thing. There’s actually a whole another navy air test and evaluation squadron, the Antarctic Development Squadron Six (VXE-6 or ANTARCTIC DEVRON SIX, commonly referred to by its nickname, The Puckered Penguins). They’re based on California (lmao) and their motto is… Well, “Courage, Sacrifice, Devotion”. Uriel kinda left behind again, huh. I’m sorry sweetie.

Again, I apologize if this last section (or even the whole thing..haha…) looks far-fetched, but I just… had to take it out of my chest, sorta? Sorry.

That concludes our Archangel Theory. Thank you if you took your time to read through it all.

**List of things to maybe expect in the future:**

* **Something on Feb 1 / Feb 2**
* **Two more angel statues, being them related to Uriel and Michael in some sort of way. I’ve tried to find any suitable matches but… there’s just too many, and as we’ve seen it may even not be officially claimed which angel is portrayed. So let’s wait and see.**
* **More pagan symbolism?**
* **Something about War??**

*Let's discuss!*"

97,[Support Only] I just had a mental breakdown and walked out of my shitty retail job.,127,2fwlr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2fwlr6/support_only_i_just_had_a_mental_breakdown_and/,33,1410269674.0,"[No Regrets]: 

26/f. Something had to give. My roommates are bullying me. My boyfriend dumped me and broke my heart. My workplace is a mess and constantly fucking up and giving me extra responsibilities with little pay. Phone broke and I have no money to replace it. This is only my 5th month living in NYC and I feel like things are out of control. 

On the upside my family sends me enough money a month to cover my rent, but that's all. 

I just can't work retail. I can't do this rat race, struggling for a paycheck shit anymore. So today I'm pawning some things and buying a laptop. I want to spend my time learning web design and programming, so that I can eventually build a career from home. In the meantime I'm thinking I'll build resumes for people from Craigslist for $15 a pop or something. Money to eat. 

If I could find a simple part time job that would be ideal, but it can't be too demanding. 

Please wish me luck. 

Edit: All of you have made me feel so much better. Since posting this this morning I've already gotten one resume request from craigslist! I'm starting to feel that this is going to end with me being in a much better position. Thank you all so much. You're awesome. :)"

100,Brooklyn DV shelter covering up child abuse and health violations,124,7fz2ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/7fz2ex/brooklyn_dv_shelter_covering_up_child_abuse_and/,12,1511821518.0,"I live in a domestic violence shelter in Brooklyn. There are several of them, this particular shelter is one of many run by CADV or center against domestic violence. This morning I heard what I had suspected for a while, one of my neighbors is beating her little girl. I heard the cries and screaming and smacking sounds from the hallway. I had been wary of this woman for some time, she had come to my apartment in the shelter a handful of times, and each time she was constantly yelling at her daughter over nothing. It was obvious to me from day one this little girl was terrified of her mother. The verbal and emotional abuse was evident, I have told the staff about it more than once. The director of social services told me she didn't think it was true ""as of right now"". They aren't reporting it. The course of action, I'm being told, is to talk to her. Seriously. They are mandated reporters. I have been sick to my stomach all day. This woman acts like her child is the worst human in existence, but she is adorable and lively and sweet. 

I landed here because I married a psychopath disguised as a human, the man never hit me in the 7 years we were together until the day he pulled out a knife because I stood up to his mind games and verbal abuse. It's been a long difficult road and we are still not safe. The shelter ignores or covers serious health violations, and the state inspections are a joke. There is a ton of verbal abuse from staff members, threatening to send us to worse shelters and throwing away all of our belongings. The idea that there is help for battered women in NYC is a joke. The HRA hands out housing vouchers so that we can get apartments, but we are given no help in finding housing, and landlords and real estate brokers refuse them even though it's an outright violation of the human rights law. 

I have been grateful for a place to sleep that is warm and dry, I can live with the roaches and occasional rat trying to gnaw it's way into our room, but I'm sick over this glossing over a small child being beaten and warnings going ignored. "

102,"Trip Report: 3 weeks in rainy/hydrangea season - Kanto, Kansai and Kyushu",116,c26mx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/c26mx6/trip_report_3_weeks_in_rainyhydrangea_season/,28,1560886087.0,"Our Japan trip was May 22-June 11, and I would definitely travel this time of year again in the future. We got rained on a bit, but there is no rain-free season and the hydrangea bloom/lack of crowds was well worth the humidity. In retrospect, 3 weeks was a little long and we definitely lost motivation to sightsee by the end.   


**Background**

My husband and I are American and in our thirties. We are generally active and hedonistic and have huge appetites. I did JET almost 10 years ago, so this was somewhat of a ""nostalgia tour"" combined with classic sightseeing. I can read and speak Japanese well enough to communicate necessities, which came in handy in rural places but was not needed in cities/tourist areas.  


**Travel/Logistics**

* Our flights cost $760 per person, New York JFK to Tokyo Narita via Alaska and Singapore Airlines with a transfer in LAX. I would 100% recommend Singapore Airlines - the food is great and the seats are big and recline more than other airlines.
* If you're like us and live &lt;3 hours from a major airport hub, consider a one-way car rental for each leg. You'll save hundreds on airfare and airport drop-off/pickup is fast.
* We purchased 14-day JR passes from a third-party site, which came to about $415 each. Definitely got our money's worth, as we took many bullet and limited express trains between Tokyo and the very southern tip of Kagoshima. I was anxious about the ""extra"" steps required, but it was smooth sailing!
* I reserved all our hotels on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) because of the flexible cancellation. This allowed us to make changes to our itinerary up until a couple weeks before the trip.
* Suica/Pasmo cards were very handy for subway and non-JR transport, and even some small rural stations had facilities to charge the cards.  


**Important Advice**

* My only real advice is to **seek out massage chairs** at department and electronics stores. Japanese massage chairs are wonderful and stores still allow shoppers to sit in them for 30 minutes at a time. They do a better job than many actual human massage therapists and it feels great after long days of sightseeing and walking on concrete.
* Try every pudding. I had pudding every night before bed...matcha pudding, Jersey milk pudding, fruity pudding, plain pudding. It's good for you. I lost a pound on the trip!

  
**TRIP REPORT**  


**May 22-23 - Tokyo**

* Traveled from NYC to Tokyo Narita via LAX. Flight landed at 7 PM and immigration took about 20 minutes total. There were many international arrivals at this time, and crowd management was excellent.
* Bought Narita Express tickets to Shinjuku, Suica cards, and hit up the 7-Eleven ATM and a vending machine for drinks.
* We weren't eligible for the round trip discount on the NEX because our trip was longer than 14 days, but if yours is 2 weeks or shorter ask for the discount - it shaves off 1000 yen from each leg of the trip.
* Arrived in Shinjuku and checked into our hotel (Hotel The Knot Shinjuku)
* Walked around Shinjuku drinking convenience store beers, ended up in Golden Gai and Kabukicho until 3 AM. Not bad!

**May 24 - Tokyo**

* Took the subway to Iidabashi Station to walk around Kagurazaka neighborhood - the ""French quarter"" with tons of cute French bakeries and restaurants. We had some nice ham/cheese bread from Paul bakery and later, conveyor belt sushi from Ganso Zushi.
* Visited Koishikawa Korakuen Garden near Iidabashi. Very pretty, worth the 300 yen entrance fee.
* Killed some time around Shinjuku Station being exhausted and exploring department stores etc. Had a second lunch of gyuudon at Matsuya, was like 400 yen.
* Met up with a friend from NYC near Tokyo Station and hit every single floor at Bic Camera, stopping for 30-minute massage chair courses.
* For dinner we had brilliant yakiniku in Hibiya and managed to stumble home. Saw a LOT of guys barfing in and around stations.

**May 25 - Tokyo**

* Woke up early and visited Meiji Shrine near Harajuku. We loved the wooded paths and impressive old growth trees on the paths, and saw a wedding party which was pretty cool.
* Yoyogi Park for the ""One Love Jamaica Festival"" - turns out there were two other international festivals there, the Laos Festival and Latin Dance festival.
* Went to the Ota Ukiyo-e Museum in Harajuku and felt an earthquake while sitting at a cafe in Jingumae! Harajuku is nuts in a weird corporate way and nothing like I remember from 2009, but it probably wasn't cool then either.
* Stopped by Koenji with every intent to explore but we were so tired we couldn't deal.
* Went back to Shinjuku and fell asleep at like 7 PM. Oops!

**May 26 - Tokyo and Kyoto**

* Still jet lagged. Went to the park near our hotel and saw a cat chasing a rat and lots of old men walking.
* Went to Don Quixote in Kabukicho at 7 AM. I do not recommend this...smelled like piss.
* Hopped in line for the Metropolitan Government Building observation deck around 8:30 AM and were fourth and fifth in line. The views were amazing!
* Headed to Tokyo Station to board the shinkansen for Kyoto. For lunch we had incredible bentos from Daimaru basement food hall.
* Arrived in Kyoto around 3 PM and checked into our apartment hotel, Glanz kei Shinmonzen. Huge room, fast wifi and cold A/C at a great price!
* Went out on a walk to explore the Gion area and Heian Jingu. Heat was oppressive. Saw a little kid crying and throwing up in the street.
* Stopped for craft beer at Beer Komachi and had just okay okonomiyaki for dinner.
* Visited Yasaka Shrine at night.

**May 27 - Kyoto**

* Woke up extra early and walked through Maruyama Park to Kiyomizu-dera. There were only about five people there and I got some pictures of empty streets on the walk up.
* Took the Keihan train to Kibune and hiked from Kibune to Kurama. Was really nice to get out of the city and into fresh clean air. The typhoon damage in the area was severe.
* Went for excellent lunch of cold soba with tempura and a soak at Kurama Onsen. Nothing like a hot bath on a really hot day...
* In the evening, we putzed around Gion and had dinner at Chao Chao Gyoza.

**May 28 - Kyoto and Nara**

* Got a slow start and arrived at Fushimi Inari at 8 AM. It was starting to get crowded and the steps were slippery in the rain, so we didn’t stay long.
* Had Toyama black ramen at Kyoto Station and took a train to Nara.
* In Nara, visited Todaiji Great Buddha Hall, maybe the most powerful sight of the entire trip.
* Deer are everywhere in our hometown but it was still fun to make the Nara Park deer bow for cookies.
* Hit up an arcade for DDR, Initial D and the game where you drive trains. I was really jazzed to play DDR on a well maintained machine!
* Saw a few geisha around Pontocho, a bunch of white people with expensive cameras stalking them, and ultimately had a low key disappointing combini dinner in bed.

**May 29 - Kyoto and Tagawa**

* Walked the Path of Philosophy, stopping at Honen-in Temple which was a Kyoto highlight for us. Very quiet and green and we liked how quiet the surrounding area is.
* Left Kyoto and headed to Tagawa City in rural Fukuoka prefecture to stay with a friend for 4 nights.
* Met up with local friends for drinks and snacks.

**May 30 - Tagawa**

* Showed my husband around Tagawa, which is a rather economically depressed former coal mining boom town.
* Used our JR passes to visit the Nanzoin reclining Buddha and mountainside temple near Sasaguri, which is absolutely amazing. I like that they don't allow busloads of tourists.
* Friends had a BBQ in their garage and we drank a ton of sake.

**May 31 - Fukuoka and Tagawa**

* Fairly hung over. We went into Fukuoka City and had the best ramen of the trip at [Hakata Men-yatai Tagumi](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=33.589635,130.416209&amp;z=18&amp;t=m&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;mapclient=apiv3&amp;cid=13086631796306316963). Perfect tonkotsu ramen! Light fragrant broth and not too heavy.
* Spent way too much time at Canal City and Tenjin before heading back.
* Went for yakitori and drinks with my former coworkers in Iizuka at a really lively place.

**June** **1 - Tagawa**

* Spent the day exploring rural outskirts of Tagawa with my friend. 
* We visited a farmer's market/rest area that has a famous [""100 Million Yen Public Toilet""](http://jp-local-life.com/michi-no-eki/) outfitted with beautiful locally made pottery, drove to a nice camping area by a river, and I had black coal soft ice cream.
* In the evening, we went to a rockabilly/retro concert featuring a band called Gold Rush from Beppu and were blown away. [Link to video](https://i.imgur.com/BFryLWo.mp4)

**June 2 - Fukuoka**

* Said a very sad goodbye, cried a bit, and went into Fukuoka City for one night. 
* Went to a healthy all you can eat buffet for dinner.
* Walked all around Tenjin and Nakasu and had some disappointing and expensive (900 yen, GTFO) gyoza at a yatai. It was just tourists and there were only \~10 yatai in the area. Oh well!

**June 3 - Kagoshima**

* Had ramen at Daruma in Hakata Station for lunch...broth was too porky and chunky for our taste and I detract 5 million points for not asking us how we wanted the noodles cooked.
* Took the shinkansen to Kagoshima and checked into our hotel, Dormy Inn, where we stayed 3 nights.
* Walked to the ferry terminal and got on a ferry to Sakurajima. It was super humid so no view, but the ferry ride itself is gorgeous.
* Explored the geo park a little and went fishing at the sea fishing park. I caught a small rockfish and lost a monster. We made friends with the guy working there, who seemed delighted to have customers.
* For dinner we went to Aji no Maruichi for black pork tonkatsu. It was easily the best meal of the entire trip, and portions were gigantic. Just sat there nodding in hog heaven the whole time.

**June 4 - Kagoshima**

* In the morning, we walked to Shiroyama Park, which on a clear day has fantastic views of Sakurajima. Shiroyama Park has a lot of rare trees, poisonous snakes (mamushi - pit viper), and was the site of Saigo Takamori's famous last samurai stand against the Japanese Imperialist Army in 1877. No Tom Cruise or Ken Watanabe sightings tho.
* The castle ruin near the bottom of Shiroyama Park is pretty much a non-sight.
* Checked out Sengan-en villa and garden and really enjoyed ourselves. The hydrangea were in full peak bloom and it was a beautiful spot with ponds, rock gardens, and a bamboo grove. Gift shop was excellent - found some houjicha gin and nice tea-related souvenirs.
* Since we liked the ferry to Sakurajima so much, we went back and tried sea fishing again - no luck this time.
* Walked around Tenmonkan and the red light district until we found a nice izakaya for dinner that specialized in kibinago - silver sprat caught in Kagoshima Bay. 

**June 5 - Kagoshima**

* Went for a hike up and down [Mt. Kaimon](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/mount-kaimon/), which is nicknamed ""Satsuma Fuji"" because of its shape. We had some issues with the bus driver telling us to get off at the wrong place (a golf course) and wasted 30 minutes explaining to a guy working there that we are experienced hikers and won't need rescuing.
* The hike itself was VERY WET on rocks and roots and there were no views due to clouds/fog, but it felt great to do it. Took us about 3 hours round trip. We saw many other hikers, most of whom were over 50 and wearing expensive mountaineering gear. 
* We managed to catch a direct train back to Kagoshima from Kaimon station. Waiting for the train was a very magical moment - the town was playing music box versions of Studio Ghibli songs over the loudspeakers! On the way back, we passed Nishi-Oyama station - the southernmost JR station in Japan!
* Saw the new Godzilla movie at Amu Plaza Kagoshima. It was ""Ladies Day"" (Wednesday is Ladies Day at many malls in Japan) so I got a discount on my movie ticket.

**June 6 - Osaka**

* Left Kagoshima after a final soak in the hotel onsen and headed for Osaka on the Sakura shinkansen. 
* Our hotel (Hotel The Flag Shinsaibashi) was really nice and right in the middle of everything.
* Ate and drank our way around Amerikamura, Shinsaibashi and Dotonbori area. The tourist hordes were THICC on Dotonbori bridge but if you go two blocks over in any direction it thinned out considerably. We had takoyaki and great okonomiyaki. 
* I went fishing in the Dotonbori canal and didn't catch shit but caught a great buzz and waved to a lot of people on tour boats. Also randomly met a bunch of teenagers from Colorado who like Shpongle.
* Ended up at Bar Cherry Bomb, an American-owned hard rock/metal bar somewhere in the sprawling infinity of ""nightlife areas"" in Shinsaibashi. Husband and I are very extroverted oversharers, so we were happy to chat with strangers in English for a bit.

**June 7 - Osaka**

* It rained a lot today, so we took it easy. Explored the shopping arcades, I got a great haircut for 2000 yen, and started eating and drinking with reckless abandon in the afternoon.
* One highlight was Silver Ball Planet in Amerikamura - all the pinball you could ever dream of playing.
* Evening was basically a grand tour of eating and drinking with no agenda. Went to Torikizoku, got excellent pizza in Namba, went to the grand opening of Edion electronics store, and had Thai food not long after the pizza. 

**June 8 - Osaka to Tokyo**

* I was pretty hung over on this day and drank like 5 Royal Milk Teas. Omurice saved me from being sick on myself. 
* We took the shinkansen to Tokyo and there was a white guy coughing, groaning and burping really loudly the whole ride...keep it classy bub.
* Stayed in Asakusa at the Khaosan Kabuki hostel in their private room - nice room, Asakusa generally was a madhouse though and I would not opt to stay there again.
* Ate some fantastic tendon (tempura on rice) at a shop nearby. Was like 500 yen for a set including pickles and miso soup. 
* Met up with a friend for a rooftop birthday party in Akasaka, which was great. We probably wouldn't have gone there on our own so it was neat to see a new area.

**June 9 - Tokyo and Mt. Mitake**

* Had delicious train station soba for lunch and headed to Mount Mitake where we had a reservation for an overnight lodging at Shokubo Komadori Sanso. We were the only guests and it was a little spooky.
* It was dumping rain, but we went for a hike anyway to a waterfall nearby. The forest was beautiful, with tall cypress trees everywhere - very atmospheric.
* Enjoyed a great Japanese dinner cooked by the host and learned that her husband was the 17th generation of his family to live in the lodge on Mount Mitake.

**June 10 - Mt. Mitake and Tokyo**

* It was still raining cats and dogs so we left pretty soon after breakfast. On the cable car ride down, we saw a Japanese serow! 
* Found Hiroshima style okonomiyaki near Kanda Station for lunch - my favorite Japanese food!
* Went souvenir shopping around Asakusa and Bic Camera in Shinjuku before meeting up with a friend for dinner and drinks at Yamachan.

**June 11**

* Last day, wahhh! We visited Sensoji Temple in the early morning before it got crowded and walked around Sumida/Skytree.
* Got in without a reservation at Sushi Bentenyama Miyako in Asakusa and enjoyed an omakase lunch course for 8100 yen per person. Huge pieces of fish, fresher than anything I've ever tasted, and beautiful rice. Glad we went for it!
* After lunch we went to Ueno for an hour or so before heading to Narita airport. 
* I won a Pickles the Frog keychain in a claw machine!!!
* Decided to YOLO and eat Ippudo ramen before our long flight back. No regrets. 920 yen.   


This post was definitely TMI, but I'm happy to answer any questions about the trip!

Eric Yearwood moved to NYC to pursue a career in acting. After struggling to get gigs for sometime, eventually he got a call from a woman calling herself Zardulu.

She said she wanted him to star in a [viral video in which a rat climbed into a sleeping man's lap in a subway terminal](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5CvWXG8gqEU) and used his phone to take a selfie. 

Zardulu trained a rat to do just that. With the help of a ""witness"" (also in on it) who filmed the whole thing, the video made its way to the media and indeed did go viral. Then eventually, an anonymous caller ""ratted"" Eric out to the media as having been involved with a staging. 

Some time later another subway rider, Matt Little, recorded [another video of a rat dragging a huge piece of pizza](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UPXUG8q4jKU) down a flight of stairs. He swears he merely happened upon the scene and is in no way affiliated with Zardulu or Yearwood. 

But, might this have still been a Zardulu trained rat and another of her stunts? There were some questionable people nearby who appeared to be homeless and perhaps facilitating the situation. According to Little's friend, Pat Baer, one man was tossing the rat food crumbs and a woman was holding people back so that Little could continue to capture video. 

There have been other rat videos as well, including [cannibal rat](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ypUzFbthEJg). 

How many of these rat escapades are being staged by Zardulu? What is Matt Little's level of involvement - innocent passerby or conspirator? What other high strangeness in the NYC area can be attributed to Zardulu? She claims to have big plans, and Eric Yearwood seems to believe she is capable of pulling them off.

So today was finals, and I got to my building at around 7:30 AM, yet the test wasn't going to start until 11:10. Alright, I thought to myself, cool. I'll have some time to waste playing mindless games on my laptop.

So I open up my MacBook and start up a CoD 4 game, and I get going. Pretty soon the noise is dwindling down in the commons and I look up to see nearly no one around. So I check my watch and see that *three hours have gone by*. It is now 10:30, and I haven't studied one ounce for this test. So I'm all like, ""well fuck,"" and I open up my notebook and start reading frantically.

Thirty minutes later I've made virtually no headway, and already know the material well enough to have a B+ going into the final, so I just think ""fuck it, I'll do it."" So I throw the book in my bag and walk off to the room where the final was going to be held.

Two hours later, the final was literally one of the worst tests I've ever taken. Fuck, it was hard. It seemed like I only knew the second half of the test because that was the most recent stuff we reviewed. So I've got that sinking feeling in my stomach because I know it'll be eating at me for the entire four-day weekend we have after finals.

Boom. My brother texts me telling me to meet him at the car. Alright, I go and throw my bag in the back, and he tells me we're going to Safeway to grab a bite to eat with a few of my friends. We hop in my car and drive off.

We get to the Safeway and walk in, heading straight for the Deli. We order and the time to pay comes up, so I reach into my pocket and grab my... fuck. No wallet. I didn't even think to bring it to the final because I thought I was heading straight back to the dorm to grab a bite. So I plead with my brother to let him cover me, and he begrudgingly does with four bucks to spare.

Cool. We eat, even though my brother and I have nothing to drink. So after we eat he tells me to pick up some milk for him and whatever I want to drink. Taking the money, I walk over to the dairy section and browse for a bit. In my sleep-deprived state, I fail to notice the little quart-sized things of milk, and instead think the only option is a bottle of Darigold ""milk"" that has chocolate and peanut butter flavoring and ZERO DAIRY.

But of course, I grab two, without reading ANYTHING. I'm like ""well it's brown, it must be chocolate milk."" Did I mention I'm DEATHLY allergic to peanuts?

I buy them and go back, and my brother's like ""what the fuck is this."" So I look at it and FAIL TO NOTICE THE PEANUT SHIT and say ""it's milk, dude,"" and of course he's like ""whatever,"" so bottoms up.

I drink the whole thing in one sitting before my brother lightly taps me on the shoulder and points to the peanut warning.

So there I am, waiting for the anaphylactic shock to set in, and grapple with my backpack to pull out my Epi-Pen when I realize it isn't there. I didn't repack it with the rest of my stuff after going on a trip. So now I think it's my final minute on earth.

I start scrambling around and screaming ""DOES ANYONE HAVE AN EPI PEN"" (getting lots of looks) when my brother taps me again and points at the ""artificial flavoring"" part of the label. So now I look like a complete idiot.

So we drive off, a very embarrassed me in the passenger's seat (my brother insisted to drive because I might still have a reaction) towards the swim team practice, jamming out to some great djent.

So we get to practice and the FIRST THING my brother does is *tell EVERYONE what happened.* So now I'm the laughing stock of the team.

Alright cool. Great. I'll never be able to live on my own.

**TLDR** massive rats attack NYC and I have a conniption on the sidewalk."
107,A COOL IDEA FOR A FALLOUT GAME,113,bfi3tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/bfi3tx/a_cool_idea_for_a_fallout_game/,72,1555800448.0,"New York City, the city is almost dead in the streets, but civilization resides on the skyscraper and towers of NYC. Building are supported with cables or certain levels of the buildings are secured for living, like on the 45th floor housing living while floor 40 is the military wing. Or entire towns are built on top of the towers and are connected with other communities via bridges and elevators. As people use solar panels to gather energy or rain water is collected to filter and drink. As near the ground is covered in a thick fog that no one can see what is going on, as many avoid it as they hear roars from various monsters and blood curdling screams from people in the fog. If you're guilty of a crime the death penalty is being sent to the ground. On the ground, you can no longer see the sky and the floor is littered with hills of debris and radioactive beasts. Along with a new faction called the Banished, a raider group that hunt people from the towers for sport and are coked up sexual fiends that are bottom tier of scum...and you can join them. The only safe places are

Harlem: A large neighborhood walled off turning the mostly black community into a safe haven for the people thrown away from the towers and are the main rivals to the banished. They send out scouts to hunt for food, supplies, and clean water. Because of the lack of sunlight on the ground, planting crops are all but impossible to grow and heavily relies on trade with Big Apple.

Big Apple: A large series of connected tunnels of the NYC metro. Big Apple is like Polis from the Metro games, built by the inhabitants of Vault 99 using the fusion generator from the Vault to power half of the underground. The vault was housed with New York's elites from celebrities, CEOs, and Socialites. The purpose was to continue life after the great war, having a food processor, underground agriculture, and water purifiers. Outposts and small living spaces are created and all answer to Big Apple.  The catch is that only those descendant from the 1,000 inhabitants of the vault may enter.

I might continue this, but what do you guys think of it?

&#x200B;

EDIT: [https://imgur.com/a/CUoYp2a](https://imgur.com/a/CUoYp2a)

&#x200B;

New Addition:  Imagine an entire tower called Greenfair was overran by monsters and the community had no choice and decided to cut the wires to the elevator to keep the creatures from progressing any further. Leaving the inhabitants to their fate. The towers  tune ham radios to communicate with one another and the radio in Greenfair tower at first was filled with a cacophony of screams, gunfire, and roars just suddenly turned silent. The occasional creek can be heard or drops of water hitting the floor on the dead broadcast. Maybe even the chatter of mutants chewing through bones and flesh of the civilians. You explore those ruins and see how a once a vibrant layered city in the tower lay in ruins. The power ran out so now the building was dark as night, you see children drawings scribbled on the walls are covered in blood splatter and claw markings, in the mess hall, the seats had been placed as barrier to the doors and tables flipped over to act as cover. The food on the trays have been spilled onto the floor and white fuzz of mold covers it.

The security sector of the tower are covered in corpses of the creatures and security teams. By how the teams were positioned it looked like a final desperate last stand, as you see half decayed or eaten bodies strewn about the floors from those in rags, to suits and fancy dresses thinking it was safer to get to where the guns were. In the security room, you see weapons still in their locks., A holotape can be found by the body of the captain. You play it and it says he locked himself inside to keep the weapons secured and says he wouldn't go out as mutant chow.

You look into the sleeping area and horrified in seeing the  beds covered in pools of blood, you look down to see markings from the nails of a person clawing on the floor leading down the hallway as if something dragged whoever was resting during the massacre. With it leading you to a boarded up doorway and peering in closer you hear chewing.

You go up further and as you walk up the stairs you see a dark brown color on the floor that trails off to the resident area of the wealthier individuals and families. The high class upper floors, though rugged and tattered was beauty in the post apocalypse was  now the breeding grounds of giant rats the size of men called Dregs. Fighting through the waves of the beasts you lead up to the building's roof and there is the greenhouse with tato, corn, carrots and all. Rotten and mold make home in their once ripe bodies. You look across at the other towers, orange lights dot them, like torches. Laughter is heard faintly as the Inkspots are playing their best jams on the radio. Little care that only several feet away lies a tomb of people that  lived like them.

On the roof there is a single corpse that belongs to the mayor of Greenfair. On his body is a holotape, in his last moments he regrets his decisions as a leader. By siphoning funds from the security budget to throw lavish parties for him and his rich friends that got him to office. Thinking that they haven't seen an attack for years mean the mutants left them be. Little did he knew they were waiting, in the end of the holotape you hear the growl of Dreg circling him.

&#x200B;

A little story with a just taste of the kind exploration this kind of place brings. With a bleak reminder of what other towers can face if they're aren't careful.

109,PSA: Tenant Rights in NYS,111,iajaxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/iajaxp/psa_tenant_rights_in_nys/,10,1597539674.0,"Hey guys, 

Recently I've seen a lot of my friends and people I know dealing with their landlords doing things that are either very legally gray, or that are blatantly illegal.

I've spent a decent amount of time reading up on tenant laws (I guess everyone needs a quarantine hobby), so here are a few things that I've heard of landlords trying to do to my friends and to people I know that are not legal in NYS.

1. Limiting occupancy: I've seen some tenants telling people they need to get approval to have people visit or stay over. Under Section 235-F (2) of NYS Real Property law, ""It shall be unlawful for a landlord to restrict occupancy of residential premises, by express lease terms or otherwise, to a tenant or tenants or to such tenants and immediate family. Any such restriction in a lease or rental agreement entered into or renewed before or after the effective date of this section shall be unenforceable as against public policy."" (https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/RPP/235-F)

2. Not fixing broken locks, windows, or ensuring a safe living space. Under NYS's Warranty of Habilitability, a landlord has a duty to ensure that any building they are leasing is safe and liveable at all times. This includes but is not limited to: Ensuring all exterior windows and doors are functional (open, close, lock, etc.), appliances provided by the landlord are functional, there are no mice/rats/vermin, there is no mold, utilities are working, etc. (https://nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/pdfs/warrantyofhabitability.pdf)

3. Trying to increase rent for any reason: A landlord may not increase the rent of a fixed term lease until after that lease period ends (so for example if you sign a 1 year lease, you only have to pay however much your lease states that you have to pay. If you choose to renew the lease, your landlord can then increase the rent. In other words, if your landlord says ""hey I'm going to increase your rent"" 5 months into a year lease, that's illegal). While your landlord can increase your rent to pay for renovations, they can only do this if you agree to the increase. Keep in mind that this is specifically for fixed-term leases; if you're in a month-to-month lease, they ARE allowed to increase rent, but they must give you at least 30 days written notice. (https://ny.curbed.com/2017/6/15/15810614/new-york-city-landlord-tenant-law-rights)

4. Last month's rent + security deposit: NYS law makes it illegal for a landlord to ask for the last month's rent as well as a security deposit at the beginning of a lease. You can choose to pay both during the first month of the lease, but they cannot coerce you into it. They can only legally ask for a month's worth of rent for any reason at the start of a lease. (https://www.brickunderground.com/rent/difference-between-last-months-rent-and-security-deposit)

5. Giving less than 24 hours notice before entering: A landlord must give at least 24 hours notice before they're allowed to enter the rental property unless you (the tenant) invite them in. So if your landlord knocks on your door and you invite them in, that's fine, but it's not fine for them to just barge in unannounced. The exception to this is if there's an emergency that they need to fix (for example your water main bursts and there's 4 inches of water on your floor) (https://realestateplanninglaw.com/lawyer/2018/01/30/Real-Estate/NY-Landlord-Rights-Right-to-Access_bl32966.htm)

If your landlord is doing any of these things (or is doing something else that seems like it may be illegal, reach out to the RPI Union lawyers. They offer free legal counsel to activity fee-paying RPI students. (https://web.archive.org/web/20171208232013/http://www.union.rpi.edu/student-legal)

And let me feel you, they are the softest and smartest lil’ creatures you will ever meet. Think of a cat mixed with a guinea-pig. Like, I don’t support most animal testing, but rats are tested on the most for a reason besides how quickly they reproduce. These dudes are smart!! 

They have also never even attempted to bite or scratch me before, they are very hygienic (lick themselves clean more often then cats and adore baths) and love doing tricks or being petted. Ideal pets and companions. 

Yet every time I mention I own rats, people are always like “ew! Gross!” And I genuinely don’t understand why. 
Is it.....like.....because of the plague from a thousand years ago?? Which was from flees and was spread by every mammal??? 

Not to even mention that comparing a domesticated rat to a common feral nyc rat is like comparing a pug to a wolf. Domesticated rats or “fancy rats”(what they are referred to by rodent circles) have been specially bread for about 200 years to be good pets. 

Also if it’s the tails that gross you out, well my good sir, you are wayyy more hairless then them just saying. 

Anyways rats are not gross. People are just misinformed."

We should vet landlords/properties too! Here's how I tried to do that in my crazy apartment hunt from out of state.

I'm sharing my experience of apartment hunting over the past few months. Many thanks to the reddit archives, and this [article](https://brooklyneagle.com/articles/2019/08/30/how-to-avoid-brooklyns-worst-landlords/) for great advice.

**There is power imbalance with renting.** Landlords vet prospective tenants with credit and background checks, pay stubs, bank account balances, prior landlord references, guarantors, etc. But tenants rarely have the ability to vet landlords. At best, maybe you can speak directly with one previous tenant and get one data point.

I present the (admittedly kind of overkill) steps I took because tenants should have the right to vet their landlords. Rent is often the most expensive thing you spend money on--let's get our money's worth!

**My Situation**: moving from out of state, budget $1800 for studio/1BR. At first was toying with idea of visiting NYC to see apartments in person, but due to work/travel bans/etc. decided in the end to rent an apartment without seeing it in person. Not ideal, but it is what it is.

**Phase 1:** make giant list of acceptable apartments

1. Searched StreetEasy based on my requirements, eg commute < 40 min to work, neighborhoods, laundry. Because I had a lot of free time on my hands, I started casually browsing 3 months ahead of time. While this was way to early for my timeline, this allowed me to get a sense of the baseline and spot chronically unrented apartments. Any place that wasn't horrendous I saved.
2. Made Excel sheet with apartment info. This allows for sorting. Columns included: Address, Rent, Region, Commute (subway lines), Commute time (min), studio or 1BR, Broker fee (yes/no), upfront costs, Broker, Move in Date, Dishwasher, Laundry in building, Link, video posted, view from GoogleMaps, Landlord, ACRIS, HPD Building profile, DOB Building profile, DOF Property tax bills, Landlord Watchlist, Localize, Property Manager reviews, Bedbug Registry, Rat Registry. 
3. Looked up address on googlemaps to get commute information, and streetview to ""see the neighborhood"". Did a walk to the nearest subway stop virtually
4. For columns Address-->GoogleMaps, got info from StreetEasy and filled in cells
5. Based on just this preliminary info, categorized apartments as ""Tier 1"" (aka laundry in building, dishwasher), and ""Tier 2"" (all others). 
6. Sorted within Tier1 / Tier2 by commute time, and ordered apartments in the order I wanted to apply to them

**Phase 2**: wait until it was 4 weeks before target move-in date. This was really hard!

**Phase 3**: vet landlord/property. Fill in Excel columns from Landlord-->Rat Registry from sources detailed below.

1. Landlord column: look up the landlord or LLC that owns building on [https://whoownswhat.justfix.nyc/en/](https://whoownswhat.justfix.nyc/en/). FANTASTIC website. They have links to ACRIS, HPD, DOB, DOF public records for buildings. 
2. ACRIS column: from button on whoownswhat website, look up deeds and mortgages on building to double check landlord / LLC. Can also get landlord's business address this way to contact them directly
3. HPD Building profile: from button on whoownswhat website, look up complaints in building, open violations, past litigation, bedbug reports (landlord reported though). They get their complaints from 311, so if you have a problem in your building and it's not being handled, please report it to 311!
4. DOB Building profile: from button on whoownswhat website, look up violations in building, often related to elevators, boilers, construction, illegal apartment conversions. 
5. DOF Property tax bills: from button on whoownswhat website, look up if landlord has paid all taxes on building. Can also see what they paid for the building itself. If landlord has lots of back taxes, seems sketchy (not sure when a tax lien would come into play?)
6. Landlord Watchlist:  [https://landlordwatchlist.com/](https://landlordwatchlist.com/) . Website a little hard to navigate, but shows the worst landlords in the boroughs.
7. Localize: [https://www.localize.city](https://www.localize.city). Lookup upcoming construction. Less comprehensive information on complaints.
8. Property Manager reviews: google the landlord, the LLC. Sometimes businesses have Yelp pages.
9. Bedbug Registry:  [https://bedbugregistry.com/search](https://bedbugregistry.com/search) for user reported bedbugs
10. Rat Registry: [http://maps.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/template?applicationName=DOH\_RIP](http://maps.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/template?applicationName=DOH_RIP)  for rodent inspections
11. Based on this deeper dive, reordered apartments in order of desirability. Also eliminated apartments with a lot of tenant complaints / pest problems. Of note, pests probably under reported.

**Phase 4:** start applying to apartments

1. Contacted brokers / landlords to request a video tour of apartment. 
2. Asked to speak with prior tenants.

1. All our sales are public. We sell ebooks direct to customers. Over time, we will make our books available through additional channels, assuming that these are effective and ethical.

2.  As  our books breach arbitrary ""sales goals,"" new art projects and new forms of our books open up as bonuses.  For instance, when one of our ebooks sells 500 copies, it becomes a print book from [OR Books](http://www.orbooks.com), the independent publisher of Julian Assange, Eileen Myles, Ed Wood, and many other dissident voices.

3.  We publish fucked-up underground fiction, poetry, and non-fiction—the kind of action that BIG CORPORATE PUBLISHING does not want and does not understand.  We are also into publishing peculiar Internet errata, like twitterbots and leaks and games and interesting code.

**Long story short, I am ready and will FIRE at 34. But I'm considering taking a ""bullshit"" or stress-free job for personal reasons and benefits. If you want a little background of my story, please read on. If not, please go straight to the points that I have highlighted in bold below. Would love to hear your opinion/view on my choices.**

I am 34, M, single with no kids, and will ""FIRE"" in 3 months. I sat down with my boss this morning and told him why and when. After a bit of going back and forth, he was totally cool with it and thanked me for giving him 3 months instead of the typical two-week notice.

Sorry, but no FIRE unicorn here. I worked in the tech field and made well over six figures for the majority of my career. I lived pretty frugally throughout my life and dumped most of my income into the stock market. As of today, my main brokerage account hovers at around 1M (actually just dipped below 1M because of today's market lol), a little under 100k in 401k, and 35k in a Roth IRA. A vast majority of my holdings in my main brokerage account are S&P 500 ETF and blue chip stocks (VOO, BRK.B, AMZN, MSFT, APPL, GOOG, NVDA, WMT, WM, T, etc. for those who care/want to know), and a small portion in more risky stocks. Both my 401k and Roth IRA are pretty much just S&P 500 ETFs.

I know this amount might not be enough for some, but for me it is. At least for now. As mentioned, I have been pretty frugal throughout my life, mainly due to the fact that I grew up in a very poor household. I still remember the days when my parents came into my room to ask for my Christmas and birthday monies that our relatives gave me in order to pay for our rent. Fortunately, those days didn't last too long. My family wasn't rich or well-off per say by the time I got to high school but we lived okay for the most part. Anyway, before I go off on a tangent, basically I just want to say that that lifestyle never left me and I actually enjoy it. My FIRE budget will be at around 30k per year including taxes/fees/whatever there might be. Of course, this number will differ a little every year but my goal is to aim at around 30k every year.  Definitely not losing sleep over a few grands above my target.

My plan for the living situation is to move from NYC to south Florida, not sure which city yet but most likely somewhere near Miami (by near I mean 1-2 hour drive, and that can get you pretty far for you big city folks). The main reasons why I'm choosing Florida are because low cost of living and state-tax free. In NYC, let alone having a state tax, we have something called the city tax... Can't and shouldn't complain tho. If it wasn't for NYC, chances are I would not have been able to FIRE at this age. Anyhow, I have lived in Florida before and love it there, so it wasn't like I solely picked it because it was cheaper to live in. I know what I'm getting into and I know what my lifestyle will be like there. And here are my main break down of the living costs:

Rent & Utils: $15000~

*As a New Yorker, housings are dirt cheap in Florida. Enough said.*

Gas, car insurance & maintenance: $1500~

*I own a 2014 Camry, fully paid off. Very little mileage (I live in NYC after all). So I'm giving myself a decent size cushion for insurance and maintenance fees here.*

Food: $5000~

*I cook a lot, one of the reasons is being frugal. Again, I'm giving myself a huge cushion here. I have been cooking for myself for almost two decades, I know how to portion my sizes to make more meals and hunt for good deals at the groceries. Thus, I'm going to skip toiletry and cleaning products in the COL because I definitely won't be needing 5k a year for food alone, I will just treat them as part of the grocery shopping bill.*

Entertainment: $1000~

*This is the part where most of you guys will start to dislike me. I know, I'm not a good person but it is what it is. I download and stream all my movies, shows, and music illegally. The only time showbiz can make a dime out of me is when I go to the movie theaters, which I rarely go to. I might go there 2 or 3 times per year. Maybe when I FIRE'd I will go more often but who knows. I suppose most of that $1000 will go toward my cellphone bill and Internet. Most if not all of my hobbies are free and/or low cost. I'm into cooking, swimming, hiking, running, kayaking, working out, browsing Reddit, watching movies, TV, sports, music (all free as I mentioned), etc.*

Travel: $2000-3000~

*Who doesn't love to travel right? Well, I do for the most part but not constantly. My goal is 1 international trip and 1 domestic trip every year. Sometimes maybe even just 1 domestic or 1 international, not both. Contrary to popular opinion, I wouldn't want to travel 24/7 even if I had the money. Traveling is exhausting in my opinion, I rather take my time and see more things per location than just ""to go there"" just to tell people that I went to all these places.*

Misc & Eating out, etc: $500~

*I rarely eat out. Mostly with friends. Even then I would pick the medium-priced items. Though this number can/might shoot up if I end up in a relationship. As boring as I sound, I do find going on restaurant dates very romantic and fun.*

That ultimately puts me at around $25000~26000 per year against my yearly income of $25500. I simply did $30000*.85 = $25500 to include the taxes/fees. Once again, some year I might live on less and some might be more, $30k is just a goal or guideline for myself. And hey, not so fast just yet, I left out one important cost that most people tend to forget about, health insurance. Which is one of the main reasons why I want to keep ""working."" 

Main reasons why I want to keep working (at a bullshit job):

**1. Ironically, it gives me a sense of life.**

This is probably the part where some of you guys will hit the backspace or close the tab, but hear me out. ""Getting out of the rat race"" is just a blanket term. This statement should be put into a form of a question, *why do you want to get out of the rat race?* For me, social anxiety plays a huge part. While my job does provide me with a good paycheck, I suffer a lot of peer pressure from upper management and people on my team. Sitting at my computer desk at 11:30pm on a Sunday evening is one the worst feelings ever, I bet you guys can agree with me on this one. It's not only the fact that I have to get up 7 in the morning and try to catch the fully packed train, but the fact that I have a boss to answer to and people to manage the moment I step inside the office. I hide it quite well, but I often panicked in front of my subordinates and my managers. Basically running all these bad thoughts and judgements inside my head. As hideous as it sounds, if money wasn't a problem, I don't mind being the lowest guy on the totem pole at work. Nobody will judge me if I screw up the most simple thing and nobody will expect me to lead them, it's 100% stress free. Being able to drive and always have a parking spot in front of the building is also a great perk as oppose to catching a packed train with grumpy commuters (Florida can definitely provide that).

I know I'm not a great writer and this isn't a good thread for a guide or anything, but if you can get anything out of this thread, make sure you test the water first before FIREing out of nowhere just because you have reached your net worth goal. Take a small sip of the hot soup first before taking a mouthful so you don't burn your tongue. Yeah, the soup is delicious but it is also freaking hot and it needs to be cooled down first. So that's exactly what I did. I purposely took 2 weeks off work with nothing scheduled ahead (no traveling, no planning stuff with family/friends ahead of time, etc.) just to get a sense of what my FIRE life would be like. The first day was amazing, I think I woke up at like 1pm and then made myself brunch. Sat around, dicked around on my PC, and that was it. Second day, repeat. Third day, I got bored and decide to hit up my friends, oh wait it was a Wed, everybody had work. So I went to the movies by myself. Fourth day, you guessed it, I got pretty bored but still enjoying the no-work life. Fifth day, I actually want to go back to work and speak with my coworkers and see some familiar faces. I mean it wasn't like, ""shit, I'm dying over here, I need to be back at work ASAP. I made a huge mistake!"" It was just that the thought suddenly crossed my mind and that I was bored out of my mind. Next two days were okay because I finally got to hang out with my friends and family. The following week was straight up, ""what the fuck am I doing with my life?"" I don't want to make it sound like it was hell and that I was suffering or anything, but I can totally see myself not being happy over time and may even fall into a depression in the long run. I really sat down and thought about it, it won't be weeks or months, but years of this. I think finding a motive in life is very important. Again, as ironic as it sounds, I think a 9-5 stress-free work schedule might just keep me sane. Of course, this is what I think will work for me. I'm not saying it's right or it's wrong. Just find what works best for yourself.

And as bad as it sounds (you gotta plan for the worst right?), what if you really didn't enjoy FIRE and want to go back to your old job? It might just be a little too late by then.

**2. Health Insurance**

This is a big one. I wonder if many of you FIRE'd people are running into the same problem. I care about my health a lot and would want to continue to go to the dentist twice a year and my physical once a year even after I FIRE'd. But health insurance is so freaking expensive without employer's help so I don't know anymore. If I can land a *bullshit* job where they can relief some of those insurance payments, I would definitely start working again.

**3. 401k**

I think this one is pretty self-explanatory. I want to continue to invest even after I FIRE'd, and one of the best investing vehicles is the 401k as it provides many tax advantages. And this goes back to my point that ""my 1M net work might not be enough for some, but for me it is, *for now*."" I see 401k as my ultimately safety net for the times I really can't work anymore. I want to continue to beef up this account, if possible. 

**4. Resume, beer money, socialize**

Continuing from the third point, what if 1M really won't last me and I will have to go back to work before my 401k and social security kick in. I don't see how not having a X amount of year gap of work will hurt me if I were to go back into the rat race. In fact, I can probably use it to show that I never really left the workforce on my resume during the job hunt. Either way, it will look better than having a huge gap of no work experience for sure. 

And of course, having few extra bucks won't hurt. Plus, meeting new people and chatting with coworkers is always fun. Lastly, everything is still up in the air for the rest of my life. I'm still single and unsure if I will have kids. I might just need that extra dough and/or going back to work in case a kid or two pop out.

Anyway, *bullshit jobs* are basically what I'm only willing to apply to and/or work for again (for now). I am thinking of some simple office job where I just do some photocopying, typing up emails, updating data, etc. Dick around for 5, work for 3, and then go home. I also thought about being a security guard. Would love to hear some suggestions on bullshit jobs to apply for. Pay is basically out of the equation for me, as long as I don't have much to do and have decent benefits, I will even take a minimum wage job if needed. And most importantly, what do you guys think of my plan of continuing working (at a bullshit job)?"

The 3rd album released under EL-P's own label: Definitive Jux, Fantastic Damage stands out as one of the first major Hip-Hop releases released in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Despite its release date, the album was actually recorded before 9/11 actually happened. Regardless, the paranoia laced throughout the album resonated with the people who listened to it at the time immensely. It became enough of an underground success to be on the Billboard 200 charts and was also a critical darling for many review sites. It took many years for this album to emerge out of the underground despite EL-P enjoying mainstream success with Run the Jewels for 7 years.  Hell, this album wasn't even put out on streaming services until just 3 months ago (physical copies have also never seen a repress in ages as well). With what's going on currently in the world, Fantastic Damage's reemergence couldn't have come at a better time and serves as an important reminder that the more things change, the more they stay the same. 

# Album Analysis: Themes

Fantastic Damage covers a myriad of themes throughout the 16 songs on the track listing: war, parental abuse, drug-induced paranoia, media fear frenzies, corporations shitting on artistic integrity in entertainment, EL's personal relationship issues, and the general paranoia that everything wrong with the world currently is only going to get so, so much worse. These themes reflect EL-P's upbringing and adult life in NYC leading into the 21st century. He had already dissolved his original group Company Flow despite riding off of the momentum of ""Funcrusher Plus"" and the falling out with Rawkus Records was even more pronounced (""Sign to Rawkus? I'd rather me mouthfucked by Nazis unconscious""). Dead Disney reflects the corporate fuckery that EL had to deal with during the founding of Definitive Jux. It was originally just ""Def Jux"", but Def Jam filed a lawsuit for the name and thus he had to change it. The rest of the song dives into a vigilante killing spree against Disney's characters and destroying Disney World itself. He makes similar comments on the entertainer industry in ""Delorean"" and the title track with references to both Star Wars and Back to the Future being uttered in his lyrics. 

It's no shock that dystopian authors like George Orwell (1984, Animal Farm) and Phillip K Dick (The Man in the High Castle) were massive inspirations for much of the album. ""Accidents Don't Happen"" flat-out samples a scene from the film adaptation of 1984. Particularly the scene in Room 101 where O'Brien interrogates Winston and reveals the whole purpose of Big Brother. Clips of O'Brien's dialogue are spread throughout the song as EL-P, Cage, and the late Camu Tao unleash dense verses paralleling the themes of 1984 into what the US government had been rapidly turning into in the late 90s and early 2000s as information warfare and the ""war on terror"" were ramping up into full gear as a means to mortgage more of our fundamental rights away. The song that precedes this (The Nang, the Front, The Bush, and the Shit)  uses the backdrop of the Vietnam War as a means to highlight how the government manipulates teenagers into signing up to the military only to have their lives thrown away over a pointless political endeavor. The lead single and most well known track off of this album (Deep Space 9mm) dives into how EL is detached from the decadency and corruption prevalent in NYC. The world is run by a few cronies that drain everyone's will to live through mindless consumerism and paranoia and all we're doing is sitting on our asses not doing anything about it and if anything, killing each other over stupid shit. Which includes EL-P himself on the hook (""Tell the historians I'm right here holding my nuts""). 

There are two songs on Fantastic Damage that primarily tackle the 3rd major theme with the record, that being EL's personal issues and anxieties surrounding both his childhood and his struggles with finding himself and caring about people he's loved in the past. The first song: Stepfather factory uses the concept of a corporation producing robotic stepfathers to both console and assist single mothers with raising a family. The consequences of these ""stepfathers"" is that they're simply cold, indifferent providers instead of actual parents and their fuel source is alcohol which has a side effect of leading the robots to attack the families they were designed to protect. EL-P is not shy about talking about the abuse that him and his mother faced at the hands of an abusive stepfather and this song is a poignant metaphor for not just EL's personal hardships, but the crumbling family structure of society in general. In fact, this is one of 3 songs (Company Flow- Last Good Sleep and another solo song titled ""For My Upstairs Neighbor (Mums the Word)""). The second song (TOJ) is meant to lyrically be a love letter to an ex of EL-P that shows that in spite of the relationship crumbling between them, he had eventually been able to see the good in himself that she had seen in him and profusely thanked her for that revelation. 

# Album Analysis: Production

The dense and diverse lyricism and themes present on this album can't hide the fact that the main reason why this album is so revered is its production. EL's use of sampling and genre-bending create a dissonant, industrial, and... funky soundscape to which the album plays through. Production as classically ""street"" as 90s boom bap hip hop was as it is ""industrial"" and ""progressive"" like contemporary artists such as Dälek were doing at the very same time. Dissonant droning intros are very common in this album. ""Accidents Don't Happen, ""The Nang, the Front, The Bush, and the Shit"", and the title track all use this to help set up the dystopian themes that these songs explore. ""Truancy"" dedicates the last few minutes of the track to an instrumental with no verse layered over it. EL allows the song to essentially break itself down until it is slowly manipulated into resembling the intro of ""The Nang..."".  The second half of the album showcases examples of funk-infused hip-hop beats throughout many tracks such as ""Lazerface's Warning"", ""Blood"" and ""Dr. Hellno and the Praying Mantus"". It's also impossible to forget the jazz influences that are laced in much of the production. EL uses jazz drumming samples on songs such as ""Deep Space 9mm"" and ""Truancy"" and it greatly enhances the tone that each beat has laid out. One line in ""Squeegee Man Shooting"" cites his biological father as the main reason why he often samples jazz in many of his beats (""Dad played jazz when he drank, it's no accident Hands on the piano and make my foot tap to it Different path, same love, Dad, thanks for passing it"").  

Every style that EL pursues on each beat is a masterclass in Hip-Hop production and allows for a wider appeal than the experimental and esoteric reputation that this album has will lead you to believe. My personal favorite beats off this record include ""Accidents Don't Happen"", ""Truancy"", and ""Tuned Mass Damper"". Each song captures specific aspects of NYC that EL-P tries to describe in these songs and they help visualize the mayhem that goes on in that city perfectly. The droning industrial rhythms of ""Accidents Don't happen help visualize the dark and gritty reality of being in a dense, disgusting, and over-policed city where everything that you do either is monitored, or feels like it's being monitored. ""Truancy's"" beat helps paint the mayhem of EL's rebellious and rambunctious childhood in the streets of New York. Skipping school, getting into fights with figures of authority, and his random interactions with the crazies that the city provides plenty of. And ""Tuned Mass Damper"" to me feels like the ultimate ""walking the streets of New York"" feel to it. I'm amazed that out of all the movies that does the same ""panning shots of NYC"" at the beginning of every damn movie taking place there, not one of those scenes uses this song to complement the scenery. I've been to NYC multiple times visiting family or just exploring shit and it's been the main staple of the shitty earbuds I use to listen to music on the streets to avoid getting robbed.

# Album Analysis: 3 Most Notable Verses 

Narrowing such a lyrical album to just going into 3 verses is drastically understating what EL says throughout this album, but these are the particular standouts that have stuck with me throughout all the years I've been listening to this album"" 

1. **""The Nang, the Front, the Bush, and the Shit""- Verse 1**: EL dives into the lies that military recruiters use to hype up the army to susceptible kids wanting to go out and blow shit up and be respected by their peers. The verse contains the most poignant line in the entire album and something that perfectly condenses the message of the song (""I'm not a mechanism born from disdain, I had to be trained""). It proceeds to describe the perspective of a soldier stuck in Saigon in 1975 as the US Embassy is being overrun with NVA troops and is trying to get on the last helicopter evacuating the last remaining Americans in Vietnam. The verse then transitions into a flashback to when the said soldier is being lectured about the joys of the military by the recruiter. He's told that he can pay for school after his service and get tons of women with uniform fetishes trying to get into his pants. That he'll be a hero to his country and that everyone will suddenly respect him more as a result. He enthusiastically signs up for the army as a result but it's very clear that this is a man that 100% regretted his decision and he now knows that he was simply being used by his government.     

 (Pass me the tiger piss)  
I tunnel rat into the hidden habits of collage dog inferno  
No turning paths back(charlie attack!)  
The half man have orders to burn the village  
And come out with both hands intact  
I'm not a mechanism born from disdain, I had to be trained  
Now I catcall with dead walkers  
I'll send a postcard form the Nang  
If I can get onto the roof in time to hang  
From the leg of this last chopper  


Son of an obese burner perturbed to grow in a row  
Of rotating blood colors on brick textures  
And others modified climates make nasty tongue plunge  
(head shots)  
With opposite of chameleon blends from cartoon dreadnoughts  
There was this parasite inside my wide intestinal tract  
That took over my bark box before I had a chance to take my life back  
And his deformed banter suprised me (where at?)  
At the recruiters office, learning how to get a head in advertising  
He said:  
""Sure, others have passed, this is a gate to definition  
But thats not the singular attraction to the setup  
Not the action or the sacrifice of past draftees  
Actually more of a layaway ducats plan  
For the young get up and go out motivators  
See the new soldiers smolder different  
From that antiquated taste of stately hatred""  
Well I came from melting options on the D train to the lobby  
See academics played second in my life  
To unmatriculated brain hobbies  
And I admire the dedication to you ranks  
Plus want the training  
Loss is not a big problem it's all about what I'd be gaining,  
""Well you'll get power, respect, an audience, a check, a car, Money for  
school, honey with uniform fetish on your tool,  
You'll travel, form bonds, be a part of something  
have a structure, catch bullets...""  
(catch bullets?)  
""...I meant cash bonus  
See this gold plaque, you could own it  
After killing half a million  
It's such a good feeling  
To earn your country's respect and love  
So what do you say son, are you my man?""  
Fuck it, sign me up 

2. **""Accidents Don't Happen""- Verse 3 (Camu Tao)-** Not a verse done by EL-P, but Camus verse on this song absolutely bangs on top of having some of the most memorable lines on the entire album. Going off on how the war on drugs has given the government a blank check to violate peoples' rights just because they use drugs. So much money is put into combating the drug industry and it's only resulted in an over-policed society where we think we're afforded many freedoms, but doing something as basic as smoking weed can ruin your entire life by being forced through the US prison system. A system that focuses on punishment rather than rehabilitation. 

> It's the year 2010, you can say what you want  
But I bet if you light this blunt, dummy, the feds'll come runnin'  
Lock you up, lock you out, you ain't tryin' to listen  
Cameras in your food, dude, look they're trying to listen  
Lock you up, lock you out, we got bugs in the house  
We're being monitored, they know we got thugs in the house  
Don't light your blunt, bitch, they'll hit you with a switch  
Hit you with a beam, hit you in the brain, make you go totally insane  
Wild out, guns in the spot, flippin' on you niggas  
They take you out, then the Feds push guns on the roof  
They take 'em out, melt you out 'cause you know too much  
After that you know your ho's get touched  
Look, Then the meaning starts  
Download your chip to a memory card  
Give your chips and send 'em to a city job 

3. **""Stepfather Factory""- Verse 1-** EL takes the perspective of a CEO of a company that's been developing robotic stepfathers to help combat the epidemic of single mothers in America. He describes how single mothers are often driven to the brink by the stresses of both parenting and the loneliness caused by not having a significant other in their life. He criticizes how technological advancements have often been used to distract people from problems rather than solve them head on. He proposes that these robots will actually serve to end the issue of faithlessness once and for all. As his speech goes on though there are subtle hints that he's losing his confidence towards his product as he stutters over his lines when it comes to describing the robot's features and composition.  It shows how corporations pander to social issues and pretend to fight for social issues when it's clear that they only care that people buy their product. 

> Spilling the leftovers of \[creational clique\]  
We grew with the concept now we're ready to go public  
Today's a big day for the company  
A big step for the little-steppers who slept for years uncomfortably  
Little man, little lady, cute little baby  
Reach your hand out to the future of automated robotics  
On display here for the first time in under a year here  
At the World's fair - but is it really?  
Ladies and Gentlemen I propose that the market  
is sinking under the weight of useless contraptions  
added to the shopping carts of all hard-working families  
Electric doodads and wizard hats \[exist\] to keep the munchkins entertained  
But get replaced by newer versions such as breakdown systematically  
Mothers - how many times have you debated sub-euthanasia tablets for breakfast snacks  
When restlessness attacks seemingly at random?  
With an emptiness inside that's hard to identify, maybe  
Pursuing obvious like pill-popping \[the cossanova edict\]  
Chances are you've been abandoned  
Well I'm no scientist, that's not what I went to school for  
And I'm not a doctor, so I don't know much about medicine  
But I'm willing to bet that you, yes you little  
what's your name sweetheart? (dada) yeah, whatever  
Get a funny feeling in your tummy when your mommy cries  
Something between woozy and confusion  
And you spend your thoughts on how the sadnessin your mommy  
can be rooted out, burned, scorched, turned out, forgotten  
Different concepts than the candy and little baby dolls or  
Whatever it is that normal kids get to think about  
Well I can honestly say that this invention is,  
Let me start by saying we've grafted only the finest stuff  
Inserted the most high tech, state of the art, with brain charted for authentic  
Truly human emotion and trained to be domestic  
Made from the most easily available materials and, uh, loosely inspected  
Guaranteed to revolutionize  
Perfectly realistic and even somewhat institutionally respected  
Robotic relative 

# Addendum

Fantastic Damage is my all-time favorite Hip-Hop album and one of my top 3 albums of any genre. It's been an extremely influential album both in my musical journey and my personal worldview as a whole. The production still feels light years ahead of its time and for a 70 min-long album, it's a shockingly easy listen for me. As I've been writing this, I've listened to the album almost a dozen times back-to-back-to-back-to-back and it never felt tiring.  It's an amazing thing that EL is finally putting out his older material again because in my opinion, I believe that is solo work as well as Company Flow are much more interesting and creative and engaging than Run the Jewels despite being a very big fan of RTJ in spite of my own comment. 

# Favorite Lyrics: 

1. ""I'm not a mechanism born from disdain, I had to be trained""- **The Nang, the Front, the Bush, and the Shit**

4. ""And now I'm grown and I still can't protect my sister  
But I know she has her mother's strength within her  
And maybe I can tap that strength and burn with greatness  
EXPOSE THESE ALCOHOLIC STEPFATHERS AND RAPISTS!""- **Constellation Funk**  
5. ""It's like the Bilderburgs came to dinner with filthy birds  
they pussy all infected I'm lookin for milky words  
they pulled my third eye out then they let it dry out  
had to pour my belief in Christ to find out""- **Accidents Don't Happen**

# Discussion Questions

1. How does this album hold up compared to EL-P's other albums as well as the stuff that he's done in both Company Flow and Run the Jewels? Is this your favorite era of EL's music? Or does something feel lacking with his style at this point in his career? 
2. When did you first listen to Fantastic Damage? Are you a (relative) newcomer to his older music? Or are you an OG that's been listening to him since the 90s? 
3. What is your favorite album that was released through Definitive Jux? If it's also Fantastic Damage feel free to add on to any characteristics I might have missed out on in this write up. 
4. How does the messaging of Fantastic Damage hold up in 2020? Are there certain lyrics and references that date the album too much to truly be an ""ageless"" record? 
5. What's your favorite album that EL-P has done? It can also extent to albums that he's produced and not just rapped on as well."

#February Predicted Schedule[New](/#label-red)

Predicting content is already tough these days but tagging a date next to it? That’s another level of fuckery. Challenge accepted nonetheless. As most of you are already aware, events are always being shifted around and nothing’s ever set stone. I strongly advise to take this schedule with a grain of salt:

|Date|Predicted Banner|Event Type|Other Possible Content|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|30-Jan|[Lunar New Year Units](https://lapis-prod-staticnews-gumi-sg.akamaized.net/prod//en/img/20200122FFBECNY2020RerunFeaturedSummon.jpg) (confirmed)|Lunar New Year|Week 2 LNY Mini-Trial, Ability Awakenings, World Reset(?), S3 CH1, Bahamut 2★|
|6-Feb|Madam Edel|Story Event|Item World|
|13-Feb|Sweet Luka/Sweet Nichol|Valentine's Day|V-Day Event, Week 2 SE Crystal Farming Stage|
|20-Feb|CG Onion Knight|King Mog|SBB: Cloud of Darkness|
|27-Feb|Fina & Dark Fina/ Lid & Jake|Raid|Week 2 KM Mini Trial, S3 CH2, Asura 2★|

###Summary:

* Based on what we’ve discovered over at r/FFBEblog, Story Events *seem* to be following a pattern of release every 21 days since Physalis’s event **for now**.

* The second week of February features Valentine’s Day on Friday so it would make sense for a V-day banner to drop on 02/13.

* Assuming we get a story continuation next week, we *should* technically also get some of the overdue Esper awakenings.

The group you smoke countless bowls/blunts with while playing video games well into the night. Halo, COD, shit man, we got a hold of a N64 and got busy playing the usual suspects (WCW vs NWO: Revenge, No Mercy, Goldeneye, Star Fox, Mario Kart, etc). Halo was definitely a priority, and we got really good. My best friend, who we'll call Mick was unusually great at Rat Race, so I just started calling him a fucking rat every time he did some rat shit in the game. It spilled into real life when he played pranks etc. D'Rat. Mick LaRata. There were tons of versions of this. 

Years after we'd all graduated and grown up, for the most part, and most of us had spread all over the world, Mick had finally decided he was staying in town for good. I'd come to visit from NYC, and would stay for a few weeks. My PS3 was still in the home I'd grown up in (didn't bother bringing it as I'd since gotten a sick gaming laptop that doubled as my movie player). I decided to get Fight Night Round 4, just because of Ali and Tyson. The Greatest AND my favorite of all time? Yes plz. It was dumb cheap off ebay, and I brought it back with me. We'd still hang out playing certain games, but there was way less weed, and it was much earlier, since we'd just do that before heading out to a party or bar or something. Another one of the team (Jay) was also in town. We all created boxers and went off on it. It was fun as hell. I ended up taking my PS3 back with me, got tired of FNR3 and basically put my ps3 in a corner. For years. I sold most of the games I had, and only kept Skyrim, RDRUN and Skate 3, since I figured I'd eventually play one of these again, or want to, and had no interest in getting a ps4. 

Mick was the biggest gamer I knew. He was actually pretty active in this sub up until the day he passed away a week before Christmas 2015. I won't go into that, but I'll say that I am most definitely not even close to being over it, and I haven't been back home since the funeral. My sister's getting married in May, so I HAVE to go back, and I'm dreaded every second that the trip inches closer, but it's something that has to be dealt with. 

Last week, I was reorganizing my closet and I see my Guitar Hero: World Tour box tucked into a corner. Looks like I never got rid of it, and everything was in the box. Welp, why not fire it up? PS3 had to update a fuckload, so the GH, I had to charge the Guitar, blah blah blah. Finally, I got jam out to One, then Knights of Cydonia. I was back in college, trying to beat someone's best score to claim this song as my own, hahaha. Then it hit me. ""Do I still have my old saves?"". Connected a controller, got off GH and I checked. MG4, Skyrim, Skate....FNR4. FNR4. It's got a few files. One was for characters. I got on Ebay, ordered the game, and waited. I got it back yesterday and checked. Updates, long loading screen, blah blah blah. Finally, I get to see, and there they were. My character, Junior's, and Mick's. I set the difficulty at max, and I went at him the same way I did last time we'd played, except this time I was angry. I was sad. Overall, though, I was happy as hell. This being the internet and all, I always thought that the [story about the guy that plays his dad's ghost on Xbox](http://s27.postimg.org/66ju7wnwz/ghost_dad.jpg) was cool albeit probably full of shit. Now, if someone out there really did lose their dad and gets to have a piece of them back, I'm really happy for them. I have a piece of my best friend back, even if it's him trying to beat the crap out of me, lol.

Thanks for reading."

Welcome All, 


You can see the post concerning this list and how its categorized/numbered @

https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsOurMusic/comments/8hhoin/hey_thisisourmusic_i_listened_to_3000_of_your/

You can see how this all kicked off @

https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsOurMusic/comments/8gkqub/thisisourmusic_ive_listened_to_your_last_3000/

Also, if there are any mistakes, comment on that post and I’ll fix it

**Hover over musician link for my feedback!**

Linked to musicians reddit post when i could.

This list is ~%5 (~150/3000+)  of the music I listened to to compile this list.

The male to female ratio on r/thisisourmusic is ludicrous  -_-
 
Keep in mind I only clicked through musicians posts on reddit. If I wasn’t linked to an album/artist page or you didn’t consistently post singles to /ThisIsOurMusic, I didn’t hear all of your music.

Furthermore, this list was all compiled by me. This means that there will be an unavoidable sense of bias (particularly in the artists) because I like what I like. I tried to be as neutral as possible. My main focuses for the selected artists were potential, developed concept, reddit activity, attention grabbing, and depth. I am sure that many of the artist’s that posted one off singles that I included in the HITS category have albums chock full of excellent music. If you disagree with any of my selections feel free to comment below, I would love to hear your opinions. However, I PROMISE that you will find the music you’re looking for in the HITS regardless. 

**[EDIT]** Shoutout

/u/MouthForWar86

/u/El_Nooch

For adding some lists of (much-needed) metal in the comments

**[EDIT]** 6/19/2018

Realized that the links were all janky on the redesigned reddit, cleaned them up.

***

As a final note, I would be really enthused for r/W0LFG4NG to host AMA’s for your favorite artists. Comment below for any artist you would like to do an AMA. Imagine what it would be like to launch a reddit borne artist into pop culture. You can’t tell me that not a single one of these musicians is worthy. Reddit is already breaching pop culture on many fronts, why not music?

125,The Underground Railroad: Kramer and Newman find an old mall train that was used back in the day to take kids on short train rides.

Immigrants catch word of this Underground Railroad and pay Kramer and Newman hundreds of dollars for a ride to 'freedom.' 

This gets lost in translation as they really get a tour of the sewers, front row seats to rat races and underground bum fights. 

The mayor (in an election year) praises Kramer and Newman for helping their fellow man and for expanding the worlds best city by leading the expansion of NYC underground. (The only logical place to grow)

George also praises Kramer ""lets see the terrorists crash a plane into our new underground freedom tunnel"""

127,Theory: Holotape on Prydwen possibly implies New York wasn't hit as hard as we think.,92,97nw43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/97nw43/theory_holotape_on_prydwen_possibly_implies_new/,42,1534381825.0,"So I've recently started up a new character (doing a BoS playthrough; however, I can already see myself knocking Maxson's ass off his own blimp) and I found a pretty interesting holotape.

Titled: Maxon Was Right (by Initiate Dresden)

""You know, before getting shipped to the Commenwealth, I thought Elder Lyons still had some good points The Brotherhood in the Capitol Wasteland, they were about helping. But this assignment, it's opened my eyes. **On the flight here, we passed city after city. Buildings taller than I've ever seen. Some that nearly clipped the Prydwen.** And who uses them now? Mutants. Freaks. Seeing all that destruction, tens of millions dead, brought on by technology run amok, it made it so clear. Elder Maxson is right. The wasteland needs to be cleansed. And we're the ones to do it.""

Since it's *safe* to assume that they steered it from the CW to Boston as the cazador flies, the only relatively large cities they'd cross over would be Philadelphia and NYC. I just feel the tone and emphasis of the building height in the holotape points solely to NYC.

We also already know that the bombs in the fallout universe favoured radiation damage over physical damage, and considering how relatively intact DC is, I believe it's not too much of a stretch for places like Manhattan to still have buildings; albeit with many more craters and carpeted in rads. I mean, the Hudson will probably spawn battles between sewer rats and Mirelurk Queens.

I'm not entirely sure what the lore states about New York City (I've seen people call it a hole. As in a crater, not the city prewar in general - I've never been), but I think looking at this and the state DC is in are good indicators.

From a business perspective; Bethesda will **eventually** make a fallout game based in New York - I mean, how could they not - it is the most recognizable US city in the eyes of the world. It embodies and symbolises many core values of the Fallout world, technologically and socially.

Perhaps this holotape was just a slight hint and a way for Beth to start unwinding some of the lore restricting them from a future location?

Or is it too much of a stretch? All I know for sure is; I've made the call, I'm off to introduce Maxson to the Boston Airport asphalt - here's hoping Desde'moan'a doesn't complain too much this time around. Thanks for reading!

EDIT: also realised this was my very first reddit post - downloaded reddit a few months ago just to follow this sub, and have been playing fallout for years. Hopefully will be able to contribute to positive discussion as much as possible! :)"

Unfortunately, there are TONS of rats all over the garbage and in the garbage cans.  It's to the point where two or three fall out every time I lift up the lid to the cans and put our trash in the bins.  When I walk up the front steps to enter our building I almost always see one running around.  I'm worried that for every one or two we see there are five or six we don't.  It's to the point that our neighbors have been putting rat traps in our garbage area to try to kill them.  


What do I do?!  Talk to the neighbors about the situation?  The landlord?  I'm worried that the landlord will simply say we took the apartment in ""as is"" condition (that's what's in our lease).  I honestly don't know what to do, we've never had an issue like this before.  Obviously, this is NYC and some rats are par for the course, but its absolutely disgusting and I can't imagine this is in compliance with NYC hosing code."
130,I hate self hating asians,85,7errce,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7errce/i_hate_self_hating_asians/,5,1511364863.0,"I don't really know how to say this. I'm an Asian American from NYC. There are a lot of other Asian Americans where I come from, so growing up I never felt like being Asian made me different or set me apart. It was just background noise to me. I never thought about it much. That's true for a lot of Asians Americans where I come from. After I started college, I became interested in perspectives from other Asians in America. I started reading posts on reddit and other places online. I read about how Asian men are seen as effeminate, weak, and undesirable. I read about how Asian women hate, ridicule, and won't date Asian guys. I read about how Asian women are subservient, docile, and compliant.

I've seen a lot of posts from Asian Americans on reddit ruminating over these things. But they seem so alien to me. I can't relate with them at all. I grew up with so many Asians that are nothing like these stereotypes. Sleazy ghetto Asians and gym rat Asians. Loud, sassy Asians. Every single Asian I know has dated other Asians, and I've never, in my whole fucking life, heard an Asian woman blast other Asians like these posts say they do. And yet so many Asians on reddit seem to be absolutely drowning in their own self-loathing, reaching a point where it seems they've even convinced themselves of the racism and mockery that others have levied against them.

But that's not what I need to get off my chest. I understand why they feel that way. If you grow up in a situation where you're the only Asian around, in a situation where you're bullied and made to feel like less than a person for it, then I understand why you start to hate yourself and why you start to hate other Asians. I'm not saying that your experiences aren't valid, or that they aren't real. But it's the people who are most discontent that will voice their grievances the loudest. Those grievances don't represent all of us. They don't even represent most of us. But people will think that they do anyway.

I don't want to treat anyone with contempt. I want to be an empathetic person. But I think I've seriously started to hate people like that. I don't know if that's okay. I don't want to hate the people who have clearly had it the worst. But I can't help but feel like people will lump us together and think of us as having the same problems. 

I don't want to inherit anyone else's problems."

Welcome to the June 2016 edition of MFA Interviews.  This month we're chatting with /u/casechopper.  if you've somehow missed casechopper in WAYWT or WSHOEWT, he's a unique guy with a unique style.  I think you're all going to like getting to know this guy a little better.   

**Tell us a little about yourself. What do you do? What are your hobbies?**

>Who I am:
I was born and spent the first half of my life in the Midwestern USA and now, in my early 30's live in a suburb of NYC. Around 12 years ago I was travelling in South America and met the woman who is now my wife. We got hitched a couple years after meeting and started a family. We currently have 6 kids and are expecting number 7 next month. My kids range in age from 1 to 10 years old. My life revolves around my work and my family. Most nights are spent at home with my kids and most weekends are spent either catching up on grocery shopping, fixing up my house or taking the kids somewhere fun.

>Work:
I'm the IT guy, product designer and purchaser for a small import company that imports clothing, art, jewelry, fabric, cosmetics and a bunch of other things from Africa. We also import African inspired items from a few other parts of the world. I get to work with lots of interesting people from all over the world. An average day would include handling quality control on incoming shipments of clothing while managing production of cosmetics products, fixing computer issues and customizing our website.

>Hobbies:
I've had many hobbies at different times. My current hobbies are raising my kids, scooter riding (I have a Kymco Agility 125 and a Genuine Buddy 50 that I ride for my daily commute) and clothing. Clothing is the hobby that's lasted the longest of any of my hobbies. It doesn't take much time and fills a need (the need to be dressed). All three of my hobbies fill specific needs (child care, transportation and being dressed).

**Ok. Before we go any further, do you have a picture of your scooters ( if you're riding one in a bad ass outfit, even better)?**

>Here are a couple shots with the Buddy scooter sitting on scooter -

**How did you get interested in clothing / fashion ?**

>I grew up around people that did not value fashion at all. When I was a small kid the fashion in my neighborhood was baggy white t-shirts and whatever pants you could find at the thrift store or Walmart. Strong colored shirts weren't a good idea (you don’t wear colors in the hood) and anything with a collar would have been way out of place.

>When I was around 10, after our house got broken into and my Dad’s car was stolen too many times my family moved to the suburbs. Fashion was still not a thing for me or anyone I knew. I worked daily for a property maintenance company cleaning low income housing (i.e. some really nasty places) and doing basic landscaping so my style, if you can call it that, was still thrift shop clothing that I could abuse horribly and not worry about it. I would wear the same clothing when not working so paint splattered t-shirts, grass stained tennis shoes and ripped up faded jeans and cargo pants were the norm.

>I moved to the NYC area when I was around 16 and I decided to upgrade my style (new beginnings and all that). I started by picking up some basic clothing from Old Navy and Aeropostale. This was a big step for me as I’d never spent more than $5 on a piece of clothing before. My outfits went from laborer clothing to graphic T’s and baggy jeans (which is what was popular then). I even branched into JNCO style jeans for a little while for casual wear.
Around 5 years ago I was getting close to graduating from college with my BS in chemical engineering and I needed to start dressing nicer for job interviews and school events. I bought a couple of cheap suits from JC Penney. I didn’t have much money or time and let the salesman convince me that I should get a size 50 (I’ve never worn a size 50 suit and was closer to a size 46). I got the pants hemmed and realized that I now had 2 terribly fitting suits that did not look good. The whole process was very uncomfortable because I didn’t know anything about how clothing should fit and how to buy good clothes. I began to visit internet forums to study what brands were good, how an outfit should fit and how tailoring works. I then spent a couple years wearing clothing that was really too formal for my lifestyle as I tried to learn what to wear. Mainly sports coats, chinos and dress shoes with an occasional tie. It took me a while to get used to dressing in this new way and stop feeling like I was out of place. 

>After a couple years of this I started getting bored with dressing “nice” and started looking for something more interesting. I spent a good bit of time on internet forums checking out what was out there and found out what I really liked. Higher end work boots, Japanese denim, leather jackets, hats. These were all clothing pieces that I liked for the way they were made and for how they looked. I began buying items that I liked whenever I could find a good deal and began growing my collection to the point it’s at now. At this point I dress the way I want in the clothing that I like. I’m not dressing to please anyone other than myself. Some of what I wear is not to others tastes and I’m cool with that. I’m not trying to start a boy band, be a rockstar, pick up girls or get hired. I’m just dressing as I do because I enjoy it.

**Side question, What's the weirdest thing you found /or encountered cleaning low income housing?**

>I had a friend who was interested in getting into the house cleaning game. Her first place to clean was an apartment and it was pretty much spotless before she started. The tenants had already cleaned so it just needed a simple wipe down. Her and another girl did it together in about 30 minutes and she was sure that this job was going to be great for her. The next job was a house and about 5 of us including her went to work on it. It was the worst house any of us had ever seen. The people had left behind their garbage in bags all throughout the main floor. There was a sofa that when moved, had a solid floor covering layer of cockroaches crawling underneath of it. The entire place was crawling with bugs. The people living there had kept a large dog in the carpeted attic and didn't let it out to pee or poop. They collected the dog poop every few weeks and dumped it in the basement. They also dumped their trash in the basement. You can imagine how terrible this place smelled. It took 3 12 hour days with a group of 5 people to get it cleaned out, fumigated, painted and habitable. That girl I started this story with didn't clean any more houses after that.

>I was throwing out the garbage at one apartment and didn't realize there was a homeless guy in the dumpster until I'd already thrown the bag in on top of him. He wasn't too upset. I think he was too crazy to get mad. He wandered off mumbling something to himself.
There was a place that had a bathtub full of dead rats. My Dad ended up cleaning that one out because all of the other guys noped out on that.

>Some of the other guys that worked there went through worse stuff. One guy was doing some work on a house and a guy and his son asked if they could look at the place. He said sure and a few minutes later they snuck up on him from behind and beat him over the head with a hammer. They left him for dead but he managed to crawl to a neighbors place and get an ambulance called. He survived but had some pretty severe disabilities afterwords. Others were shot at or had things stolen while working. There were some houses that I wouldn't work on due to where they were located. Certain streets were no go zones for someone my age. Some of the older guys would go armed and take care of maintenance at those places.

**Damn. I knew that was going to get an interesting story or two but....wow.  Can you describe your personal style? Maybe include a few pictures of outfits that showcase your style ?**

>My personal style is mainly inspired by early 20th century workwear. Jeans, boots, leather jacket and hats are what I find interesting so that is what I incorporate into my style. Durability and graceful aging are important to me. I also like a bit of fun casual so novelty print shirts, bright colored socks, etc make an occasional appearance.
Here are a few recent outfits that fit into my style:

[Casual weekend wear](http://i.imgur.com/ZWJbySEh.jpg)

**You're known for your eclectic boot collection - some with unusual leathers. Can you tell us a little about them? What are your favorites?**

>Most of my exotic boots came 2nd hand from another collector that wanted to slim his collection down a bit. New boots made from exotic leathers are a bit too expensive for me to justify them. I've had shark, elephant, hippo, alligator bullhide and ostrich. My favorite leather is elephant. It's almost impossible to scuff it, it's light and has a cool look/texture. Shark was interesting and is supposed to be similar to elephant in durability. I ended up selling my shark pair as the fit didn't work for me. Bullhide has a cool texture and is generally more flexible than regular cow leather. Alligator is cool looking but isn't as durable as elephant and is very expensive. I have 2 pairs of alligator boots right now and may end up selling one because I don't wear them enough to justify having 2 pairs. I worry that I'll ruin them when I wear them to work and I don't like having to be overly careful of my clothing when working.
My favorite boots out of my entire collection would be my [Nick's bow hunters in roughout bullhide](http://i.imgur.com/g300d2Wh.jpg) with my [Blackjack Elephant boots coming in a close second](http://i.imgur.com/p2nAFoeh.jpg).

**How many pairs of boots are in your collection at the moment?**

>I've lost count. I've sold a half dozen pairs in the last couple of months. Somewhere around 35 pairs at the moment.

**You also seem to have a pretty large hat collection, something thats pretty uncommon among MFA users. Can you share a little bit about your collection? What are your favorites?**

>The first expensive clothing items I purchased were hats. I've loved hats since I was a kid but hadn't found anything nice that fit me until around 5 years ago. I was also too self conscious to wear hats when I was younger. I have around 18 hats now. I mostly wear my Akubra hats as they're very durable and relatively inexpensive. My most used hat is my [Akubra Campdraft](http://i.imgur.com/D53xMsEh.jpg). My favorite hats for sentimental reasons are my [VS Max photo 2](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4pY2W-ydo2U/UBfcwaZS3KI/AAAAAAAABio/RtHLz_UJ9c0/s1095/IMG_8741.JPG) and [VS Carlota Photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/ZFjfi0ol.jpg) They're named for my twin son and daughter who died around 8 years ago. I had the hats custom made to remember them with and I won't ever sell them.

**I think we've established that you have a pretty unique style. Do you ever get comments from people in real life, positive or negative?**

>I've only received positive comments. Usually about my hats or jackets and occasionally about my boots. I do get weird looks when wearing my more out there stuff but It's pretty rare that anyone comments on anything in real life. Most people are too shy to actually say anything to a stranger.

**Hypothetical question. Father Clarks, the great patron saint of MFA, has offered you one item of footwear or clothing. Anything you want, cost is no concern. What do you choose?**

>I'm at a point where there isn't anything I strongly desire that I don't already have. There are a few jackets that I like that are out of my price range such as a [Mister Freedom Campus jacket](http://www.misterfreedom.com/campus-jacket-natural.html) or a [2 tone Himel Avro](http://www.thefedoralounge.com/attachments/image-jpg.19411/) or [Himel Canuck](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9c/65/fe/9c65fe106205fe8a9f1fcd94db3da00c.jpg) but I'm really fine with what I have now.

**Last question; do you have any advice for people just getting interested in fashion or trying to dress better?**

>Try lots of different things. Be ok with looking stupid sometimes. You won't learn if you don't make mistakes and clothing mistakes can be embarrassing. If you box yourself in and don't try anything interesting because you're worried what people will think then you won't enjoy clothing as a hobby. Try wearing a crazy hat or cowboy boots for a few days and you'll find out how little the people you pass on the street really care. If you change your style then your friends and family will comment on it. They may make fun of you but after a month or 2 they'll get used to it and won't notice any more. The important takeaway being that if you have the freedom to wear what you want then wear the clothing that you like. Don't let idiots who hate on everything stop you from enjoying the things that give you happiness.

>Taking outfit photos is a good way to see how your clothing looks. Even if you aren't posting it online, just taking the photos and looking at them yourself is a good way to see what works for you and what doesn't. Looking at the outfits of others here on MFA and other internet forums is also a good way to find inspiration and see what works/doesn't work.

134,Was I unfairly fired? (NYC),86,40sjsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/40sjsv/was_i_unfairly_fired_nyc/,12,1452699867.0,"Hello there, I'll try to make this as brief as possible so please bear with me.

I live in NYC where I worked for a small mobile paper shredding company as a Driver/Shredder. The jist of the job was basically driving the truck to companies and individuals throughout the five boroughs and provide onsite shredding of their personal documents. The most recent stop however was very different than what I was used to and I wound up getting fired for refusing to complete it. The conditions were unsafe IMO; the room I had to work in, and boxes of paper I was supposed to handle were infested with rats and completely covered with rat droppings. You don't need to be a genius to know that diseases are transmitted through this stuff, and I was even warned by the client that rats might be hiding inside the boxes. Once I started opening everything, I could not proceed because there were droppings littered inside and I did not want any of it near me, else I risked getting sick.

I stopped what I was doing to call up my supervisor and informed him of the conditions. Long story short, he tried convincing me to do it, telling me I was being dramatic and it was no big deal, etc and said I would have to either do the stop or go home. I chose to go home and when I drove the truck back to the base, he was there waiting for me and requested all company property to be returned and told me I was fired.

If it was any other job, I would probably move on and just forget about it but my supervisor has a tendency for doing stuff like this. He would routinely take money out of my paycheck without asking me for parking tickets I never knew I got. When I would go through tolls, he'd dock my pay as well. He also refused to assist me in any way with paying hospital bills when I sustained and on the job injury, and I had to do it all of it myself (finding out the job's insurance carrier and sending documents and bills where they needed to go). I have a scar on my face from this job, and he had asked if I could get everything covered under my father's insurance instead of going through he job.

There are a multitude of other questionable decisions he's made but I think I've made my point. I already filed for unemployment, but is there anything else I can do?

136,Jafar: Bridal Shower Weekend/Tale of the Dickyard!,85,48sidd,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/48sidd/jafar_bridal_shower_weekendtale_of_the_dickyard/,32,1457019939.0,"
Welcome, friends, to The Tale of the Dickyard! If you don't have the backstory/cast of characters, to the Bot with ye! (For the full effect of this story, it's best you catch up. 'Tis but two posts.) On with the show...

Recently, my maid of honor and her mother - my godmother - threw me the most beautiful bridal shower in our hometown with the most adorable cookies and white hot chocolate and...anyway. Though I had not seen Jafar in person in about two years and only had necessary wedding/holiday related communication through FDH (on purpose, story for that to come at a later date), I had been trying to be as accommodating as possible with wedding things and decided to extend an invitation to Jafar and FSIL.


As soon as I knew the date, I let Jafar and FSIL know to save it since they would need to travel by air, and asked Jafar if there were any friends of hers/family that should be invited. She told me she would have to think about it and never got back to me, eventually e-mailing my MOH after invitations went out to inform her (not ask) that she would be bringing a friend that I had met (on the occasion that caused my LC, but again, later) - which was absolutely fine, I was just a little miffed at the etiquette faux pas. Whatever, it's far from the worst thing she had ever done, I would have been happy to include this friend in the first place, and MOH/Mother of MOH are super polite and accommodating, so it made no difference to them. It was just weird, but no big deal. If anything, having that friend there was more of a safeguard against terrible Jafar behavior, since Jafar cares more about what friends and strangers perceive than what she chooses to do or say to her family. She's fine with being a shit person, as long as she doesn't get caught. FSIL decided not to come for some made up compulsive liar reason, but it was no sweat off my back.

So everyone who knows what to expect from Jafar was prepared to batten down the hatches, expecting some sort of craziness and noise. Fortunately, and fortunately for the wedding, my family will stand for none of that and already know who she is. I and several ladies in my family traveled down early so we could have family time together, and all of that was lovely. The next day, the day before the shower, I was to meet Jafar and friend (Should I call her Iago? That seems like too big of an opportunity to miss. I'll do that) at the potential rehearsal dinner location to TASTE THE DAMN FOOD (see: previous post).


So, all day, family and I wonder aloud about whether or not I will survive this lunch with all of my limbs/maintain my sparkling clean criminal record. What fresh hell could she unleash????


...Nothing. She was fine. Great even. What. Like a regular person. The usual amount of ""my cancer"" made it in, and when I asked if she had any song suggestions for the Mother/Son dance she asked if there were any songs about ruining her body, and there was one comment about how strange it is that we could be having an actual get along experience, but beyond that, fine. We all talked for three hours and had a lovely, regular human time. I'm going to assume this is all thanks to not wanting to look like a jackass to me, again, in front of Iago. I was floored, and told FDH - who had been anxiously awaiting the results of our summit - that if she was like this all the time, we would be absolutely fine. He was shocked. Oh, and in case you were wondering, the food was fine. The place was fine. CAN WE DECIDE NOW.

So, we are all left wondering if this unusual good behavior would continue through the shower the next day. Guess what. SHE WAS PERFECT AGAIN. Sure, she let everyone in the world know she had cancer/got a haircut because cancer/didn't go dress shopping because cancer and ""terrifying diarrhea,"" but again, small potatoes. My dad even came by for a bit at the end of the shower, and he and my mother - who both think Jafar the worst person on the planet - separately remarked on how astonishingly well behaved (aside from the weird non-event comments) she was. For a shining moment we allowed ourselves to believe a new leaf was a-turnin'. Oh, past me and family, how wrong you were.


Let me set the scene: During the shower, weather reports came in that indicated a gnarly snowstorm. Some guests who had to drive left a bit early to be safe, and it turned out that some had their drives extended from 4 hours to 10. One had a flight rerouted from NYC to Buffalo, which, if you know how maps work, is about 7 hours from NYC, and they had to be bussed back by the airline. The heat in my Dad's house went out. I delayed my own travel by a day. All in all, gnarly, and we knew it was going to be gnarly. Thankfully, FDH was able to catch his flight from where he was working to the city where we live and make it back there the day of the shower, while I remained in the shower place/hometown.


So, because the heater was out, myself, my dad, and my brother had a grownup sleepover at MOH's parents house, because we are all besties and it's across the street and we are adorable so paint a picture of us. All of us sit around at the table, playing cards and commenting on how beautiful the shower was, and how shocked we were that Jafar behaved.


Come to discover that Jafar and Iago's flight is scheduled to connect to our home city. 


Background: FDH and I are messy. Certainly not dirty/filthy/dying of disease/hoarder level, but we have stuff. You need to call ahead before coming. Not a secret. We like to spend our time doing fun stuff and not straightening up, but we are working on being good adults and we don't care because we are great people who happen to be messy. Because nobody was coming to my house, I left it in it's usual disheveled state to travel to the shower. Once I discovered the storm, however, I forewarned FDH to get to cleaning, because we all know that something is going to happen with their connecting flight and she is going to want to be at our house. He, having just come back from an exhausting work trip, was super thrilled to have to rush to do what would be a full day of work in several hours for a hypothetical situation. I told him ok, don't worry about it. In the unlikely event that they get stuck there, it will be late, they will stay in a hotel near the airport, and you will meet them for breakfast in the morning. Also, our guest room is full of wedding stuff to a capacity that, if he ""cleaned it,"" we would still have no room for them to sleep. Not to mention no food, no clean towels, nothing to entertain with. If you caught my first post, this is the woman who wouldn't come to greet me when I first came to her home because her home wasn't clean enough to her liking. I can be both a person who is messy and a person who likes a presentable home when guests do come. Further background: We have lived here three years. Jafar and FFIL have not come/expressed a desire to come once. She has not seen my home, and I certainly don't want her there in circumstances beyond my control. He agrees, and quits the cleaning because it's just impossible.


Lo and behold, their connection is cancelled, and Jafar calls FDH asking if they can stay at our house. He begins his sentence ""not really, the guestroom is a mess but..."" And she hangs up. Little did she know, the end of the sentence was ""...let me clean it up and come get you,"" but she heard the answer she was looking for and decided against having a conversation at all. 


Now, let us all remember, she had just earned so many brownie points from the shower weekend LITERALLY THAT DAY, and one might think she would want to keep them for a bit. Not so. She immediately begins sending FDH texts about how he is a piece of shit, how dare he embarrass her like this in front of her friend, she is entitled to be able to go to her son's house whenever she likes without notice (List of things to which you are entitled:______), she wouldn't say anything about the mess (she would, she and Iago mocked my messy car for over a year, let's be real)...etc. Long rambling paragraphs calling him nasty names and saying nasty things about me, our life, our choices, any sort of baggage she could invent. Including the crap from my first post about how I am responsible for her mental illness, and how this issue with FDH has made cancer come back because that is how cancer works and I bet you can just feel it rising within your body, can't you. Scorched Earth. Throw everything at him to see what sticks. At first FDH would not tell me how bad these texts were, but called me freaking out that ""he said no and shouldn't have said no,"" blaming himself. ""You didn't say no,"" I said, ""you were not given the opportunity to speak. You did not immediately say YES LET ME THROW YOU A PARADE TO WHICH YOU ARE ENTITLED MY QUEEN, and because of your mistake of hesitating, you shall be punished."" I made it clear to him that under no circumstances should she be calling him hurtful names, which later included the 100% invented but obviously insulting ""Dickyard."" Let's be clear, even if he said no, the reaction from her is neither proportional nor acceptable. Also, what the flying fart is a ""Dickyard?""


Later, she commented on a sweet photo of a drawing I made of our little family (pets, us) he posted on Facebook, and all he saw was the word ""fucktard"" in reference to him before he deleted the post. Again, the vast majority of this vitriol is directed at him, her son, not me, the Evil Witch. Now, not only is she calling him hateful things in private, but she is doing it in public too. Block block block. Oh, and a bit of the ""maybe I will schedule a vacation during the wedding/well then I won't come and no one will/etc."" emotional blackmail crap. Intellectually, FDH knows she is 100% in the wrong, but that doesn't make any of it hurt less from your mother.

At this point, we come to realize that the level of vile, hateful words is, even for Jafar, at a new high. FDH reaches out to FFIL and says hey, you need to take her to a doctor. Either she is sick, or is terrible, but this is not ok. FFIL tells FDH that if FDH has a problem with Jafar, he should take it up with her. Then, to prove the point, FDH shows FFIL verbatim what she is saying, and FFIL is shocked and gets the point - though I don't know how he, of any of us, can claim shock at this point. At one point later in the week, she says ""maybe I should do an inpatient treatment"" and I immediately ask FDH ""when when when how much can I pay oh dear god yes do it you slithering nutbag."" Or something like that. We never heard about that again.


Jafar then texts FDH more hateful things over the course of the next few nights, and when FDH doesn't respond quickly enough at 2:00 am, she sends ""tick tick tick...the minutes of my life going by."" He puts her on Do Not Disturb. 

Eventually, because this is how abuse works, FDH lets things settle back into ""nice"" behavior. I'm not so quick to forget. I make it clear to FDH that I have no interest in talking to her or about her, that how she treats her own child is physically disgusting to me, etc. He is not to give her any details of our lives beyond necessary wedding info, and I couldn't give a rat's ass if they came other than the effect if would have on FDH. I told him I cannot stand to watch someone treat him like this, ESPECIALLY the person who is supposed to love you most in the world, and that I was essentially NC. I tell him that he is being abused, he has been abused, and that she has no right to come drop turds in the pool of our lives like this. It is his decision to make whether to cut her off for good after the wedding, but he knows where I stand. And I certainly don't want their money for the rehearsal dinner knowing I intend to turf them, not to mention her recent bit of ""maybe I won't come,"" so I'm going to work with my parents to put in a backup plan. We have guests, it is our wedding, I'm not playing this game. He knows I will not hesitate to make future children NC, but at this point, I can't do anything more for FDH. This is his decision to make, and I can't be the person who pressures him into NC. He knows where I stand, he knows I am on his team unconditionally, and I see him slowly realizing how he is being treated. Any advice you guys have about working with your significant other to help them get through such a situation would be greatly appreciated.

So, until next time..."

### What's Your Pronoun? Dennis Baron With Diana Tourjée, 2/4

How did we get from he and she to zie and hir -- and singular they? While it may seem like adding preferred pronouns to email signatures and nametags at conferences is part of the zeitgeist, pioneering linguist Dennis Baron provides historical points of reference that shed light on a long tradition of coining gender pronouns. Shakespeare invoked the use of singular they and women adopted the generic use of he to assert their right to vote. What’s Your Pronoun? examines the role pronouns have historically played in determining our rights and identities. From legislation to literature to the press, Baron shows the many areas of life where pronoun-expression matters and affects the way we treat different groups. Baron is joined by award-winning journalist for Vice, Diana Tourjée.

### This, That, and the Third, 2/6

Wayfarers invites you to the first New York exhibition of the multiform narrative work by interdisciplinary artist Alexis Rivierre. The exhibit features five hand-sewn, embellished masks, six self-portraits, and 50 accompanying quick response (QR) codes that feature public performances, written text, and supplemental imagery. When viewed in tandem, they create fractured narratives making reference to historically stereotypical representations of black women in media and film, dominance politics, and the sociopolitical consequences of existing as a marginalized individual in public space. Also at the reception: John Mejia's The Puerto Rican War tells the story of Puerto Rican revolutionaries in 1950 with costumes, puppets and marionettes.

### Home/Land Opening Reception, 2/2

Curated by Katie Fuller, Home/Land looks at the influence of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 on Lewis Latimer’s family, focusing on the tactics used to detain, deport, and re-enslave “runaways” with current practices used by Immigration Customs Enforcement to control the influx of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.

The exhibition pairs true stories of those who escaped or attempted to escape slavery in the years surrounding the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 with current experiences of families attempting to migrate to the United States with the hope of finding a home in the land of the free.

Participating artists were given access to primary source documents from the past to create works that show a connection between then and now. Basing their art pieces on families’ migration journeys and their encounters with ICE brings the pain of the past into the present. Excerpts from historical documents: runaway slave ads, letters, journal entries, will be posted on the wall next to the art piece. Displayed together, the documents and the artworks will ask viewers what, if anything, has changed regarding how this country treats humans labeled as “illegal”.

Selected artists to be announced soon.

The exhibition will be on view through Sunday, June 14, 2020.

RSVP on Eventbrite.

### Turn & Learn Compost Work Day (NYC Compost Project), 2/8

Enjoy the fresh air and beautiful surroundings while working on the NYC Compost Project demonstration site. The best way to learn about compost is to make it, and attending our Turn & Learns will make you a pro. Bring a water bottle, wear closed-toed shoes and clothes you don’t mind getting dirty. If you help us make compost, you can take compost. Please bring your own container.  (Please note this is a volunteer event and not a pick-up event. You must volunteer at the work day to receive compost. Supplies may be limited.) Registration is strongly recommended.

Registration requested.

The NYC Compost Project, created by the NYC Department of Sanitation (DSNY) in 1993, works to rebuild NYC’s soils by providing New Yorkers with the knowledge, skills, and opportunities they need to make and use compost locally. NYC Compost Project programs are implemented by DSNY-funded teams at seven host organizations, including Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Big Reuse, Earth Matter NY, Lower East Side Ecology Center, Queens Botanical Garden, Snug Harbor Cultural Center & Botanical Garden, and The New York Botanical Garden.

139,Plot holes,79,g1d1wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManifestNBC/comments/g1d1wq/plot_holes/,43,1586895526.0,"Thanks to quarantine, I binge watched the show in two days. Unfortunately, binging it makes plot holes more apparent than watching it week by week. Things I’ve noticed - feel free to explain if I didn’t notice that they filled them / I misunderstood something, or to post other plot holes you noticed, or theories about ones I’ve noted : 

-Olive is pretty upset over the loss of Danny, a father figure in her life. She makes it clear she still wants him in her life and says “He’s my dad, too”, and Danny says he wouldn’t be able to stand losing her as a pseudo-daughter. They show her spending time with him with rock climbing to maintain her relationship with him, but after the first half of the season or so, she seems to forget about him and climbing Acadia. I understand that these things can maybe happen off-screen, but if I remember correctly, they run into him on the street at the end of the season after Grace finds out she’s pregnant, and Olive and Danny both seem distant, as if they haven’t seen each other in awhile and have no plans to see each other in the future.

-Grace borrows Danny’s truck. Ben says to tell him thanks for the favor or something like that. Grace says “IF I see him, I will.” ... She’s gonna give the truck back but maybe not see him? I guess she could drop it off in a parking garage or something and take a cab home, but you’d think you’d see the person to at least give back the keys. Probably nit-picky, but it bothered me.

-In General, for it having been a major plot point, they seemed to have dropped the Danny story without really explaining how Grace has coped with essentially losing a three+ year relationship with a man she was very much in love with. I get it, her husband is back from the dead, but that complication deserved more story time than it got, at least as far as Olive is concerned. Something simple such as the occasional comment from Olive “See you guys later, going climbing with Danny!” could have saved that plot.

-The Internal Affairs investigation of Mick! They completely drop this after Jared “arrests” Mick, with no explanation. IA just completely forgets about everything they were going after her for?? All of a sudden she’s part of the undercover op and out of hot water that even the captain seemed unable to stop. Jared, too.

-Was Mick already a detective when she came back from desk duty? It didn’t seem like she was at first, just a regular cop, and then one day she was a detective like Jared, with no mention of a promotion. She was super impressed that Jared received Detective status while she was gone first episode, implying that she isn’t one herself.

-Too many police cases that seem like they wouldn’t fall under the responsibility of detectives in NYC that Mick and Jared handle. They show up on the scene of drug busts, homicides, bank robberies, hate crime groups, terrorist cells. The most glaring one was the meth lab bust. They have reason to believe that this is going to be a pretty large bust. But Mick & Jared show up, with NO BACKUP, to take this down themselves. It’s NYC! Their police division is HUGE. The DEA is most certainly who would be involved in this first and foremost, and the DEA has their own swat team for big drug busts. I understand that Jared & Mick have to be there for the sake of the plot and the callings, but damn, guys, get some backup! 

-The meth guys kill two police officers on route to being transferred to Rikers. Is there not a city / state wide manhunt ensuing for these dudes prior to the kidnapping when the bus holding prisoners doesn’t show up as scheduled?? Jared & Mick were literally the arresting officers and they were blindsided. 

-Unrealistic that no one else in NYPD would know about Jared’s under cover op for the X’ers. I also find it hard to believe that Mick is that clueless that she, as a cop who does undercover work herself, wouldn’t even consider that as a possibility.

-Ben suddenly reads Latin. They need TJ as a translator, and then randomly Ben is like “Oh hey here’s this sentence that you missed! *proceeds to interpret Latin flawlessly*

-Vance’s replacement guy gets kidnapped and we never hear from that dude again. So the new NSA director gets kidnapped by US military black ops, and we just kinda forget about it?

-The pilot and the mirror neuron lady. Supposedly the Air Force shoots them down but I’m pretty sure we hear them mention that they don’t know where the plane went down. It was during a bad storm and we’re lead to believe, by way of editing and lack of dialogue to the contrary, that there’s a chance the pilot succeeded in his mission to time travel. And we never hear from that story again. On screen, they never confirm they found the plane or bodies. All we see is Ben marking them as deceased on his board. Are we supposed to take that to mean they did recover the plane & bodies? Otherwise surely Ben would have been like “holy shit it worked again!” or at least stay true to the skeptic he (sometimes) is. 
      ETA: He watched the digital projection of the plane disappear off the map - the audience is left to speculate whether it truly got shot down, or if it disappeared into a black hole on its own ala 828. That part certainly will get addressed in future episodes, if we get them, but the true plot hole lies in Ben’s reaction. Does he just take the military at its word that the plane crashed, rather than disappear into the void as the pilot intended? Ben is a skeptic and a bit of a conspiracy theorist. It seems unlikely that he wouldn’t at the very least opine out loud (to the audience) questioning their fate and putting their pictures into the “unknown” section of his 828 wall, rather than being placing them in the deceased section in utter defeat.

-Speaking of mirror neuron lady. They move all those people that the military were running experiments on to *her facility* that she said she has access to through Spring. Then she dies / disappears. What happened to all those people? Did they get moved somewhere else? Did they ever recover? Are their brains still all linked up? Who is taking care of them? They completely dropped that story! Hoping they’ll explain their fate in the future, but it would’ve been nice to hear Saanvi mention a few updates about their game plan for the catatonic passengers.

-The shadows. While I certainly feel like this was a huge missed opportunity for something far more mythological than a foreshadowing of three violent meth heads kidnapping a kid for ransom, it isn’t technically a plot hole. That being said, why did Adrian get haunted by the shadows, too, when it had nothing to do with him?

-The church of believers. I guess we’re lead to believe that this cult just disbands after Adrian goes on the run post nightclub fire, but it’s never really addressed. 

-Grace’s Callings. It’s stated that she’s having callings because she’s pregnant with Bens’ baby. But after she has the baby, we never see them address this. She doesn’t have callings anymore, so far, but what does this mean for the baby? 

-The X’ers & the nightclub fire. Can’t tell if this is a plot hole, or if they just intentionally mislead the audience by doing careful cuts to make us think one way or the other. Who was the squirrelly cult dude acting with to poison all of champagne bottles? The way it’s cut makes it look like it was the Xers, with the bartenders brother saying they’ve “got their part covered” to Jared on the phone and the scene is interspliced with cuts of poisoning the champagne bottles, but then later Jared says it wasn’t and the leader implies that so far they’ve taken a non violent approach. So... was it or was it not the X’ers? If it wasn’t the X’ers, who the hell helped the rogue worshiper guy? Because he certainly didn’t throw a deadly club rager with a fuck ton of spiked booze by himself.

-Speaking of poisoned champagne: We see at least 4 people pass out after drinking the champagne. Certainly, with it being free, a lot more people would have collapsed as well. But only 6 people die in the fire? After the whole damn building exploded with seemingly little time to do an immediate search and rescue of dead-weight unconscious people prior to explosion??

-Bethany. We see her get arrested & charged with multiple felonies. She’s briefly out on bail I think? It’s later mentioned that she’s in jail. But then she’s at the nightclub getting her groove on.

-If Saanvi removed her gene, does she no longer have a death date? She no longer has Callings. Seemingly she never wound up removing Zeke’s, as she was still looking for a cure for him. Why not, if she removed her own? There was plenty of time after her manic episode and before she got shut down. And apart from debrieding his frostbite, what treatments was Zeke even getting from her? Also, the Major says “there is no cure” - but Saanvi literally succeeded, albeit with some bad side effects, in removing her genetic marker and stopping her callings!

-Are we supposed to believe that the hospital was just letting Saanvi do all of this clearly unrelated-to-cancer research with no accountability and still has full medical credentials and lab to herself? Do they think she’s doing more cancer research? Is she doing enough actual cancer research to cover her tail or something?

-Lab tech guys fate unanswered.

-Did the Singularity project get absorbed by the military? I get that maybe it’s something that will be brought up later, but the characters suddenly stopped obsessing over it and replaced it with the death date instead. Did they forget that the government is literally treating fellow passengers like human lab rats?

-Ben got fired and officials show up at the BBQ looking for him. Then the mine explosion happens and suddenly he’s getting away with his crimes scott free? Vance “died” and had to go super under cover before he would have had a chance to sweep that under the rug for him.

-Cal’s leukemia. We see him getting treated with Saanvi’s miracle meds on the pilot and there’s zero follow up to his condition. Most of the first season takes place in a matter of a few weeks. 6 months to live to completely cured within less than a month?

ETA from commenter below: Lourdes. They tried to wrap this up by saying she left, but like... did her and Jared get divorced? Did she completely sever her lifelong friendship with Mick? I have so many questions.

I get suspension of disbelief for the sake of a Sci fi TV show, but I do think the show just gets downright lazy with it sometimes."

### Exhibition: In the Company of Harold Prince 

No one did more to define the American musical today than Harold “Hal” Prince. His resume included some of the most important titles of the past century: West Side Story, Fiddler on the Roof, Cabaret, Company, Sweeney Todd, and The Phantom of the Opera. In the Company of Hal Prince will explore Prince’s reinvention of musical theatre from the script- and score-based model created by Rodgers and Hammerstein and George Abbott to a more visual, almost cinematic art form in which the director is auteur. Prince acknowledged that fruitful collaboration...

### War on the Weekends: Hong Kong in a Year of Uprisings 2/12

Join Chino and Wren, recently returned from Hong Kong, for a discussion on the Hong Kong uprisings. The protests, misunderstood among the international left, express the deep-seated popular discontent with political authoritarianism and economic inequality–much like other recent global rebellions, but in a unique context. We will discuss the movement’s street tactics, broader political meaning and direction, strengths and potential limitations. Hong Kong organizers will join us over video for on-the-ground perspectives.   Wren and Chino May are both members of Unity and Struggle, a small nationwide anti-state communist collective, and organize in the Bronx with Take Back the Bronx. They traveled to Hong Kong most recently in November 2019, to learn from family, friends and comrades taking part in the movement.

Intended to gather intelligence and carry out sabotage operations, the unit consisted of Jews who were native to the Arab world and could thus easily assu…

Shameless self-promotion: I hope to have a simple webapp up and running by next week, to search by tags & location. If you are intersted, let me know and I will DM you when it is available. Alternatively, I will plug it in my post next week."
142,Two TaoBao Hauls + Collective /RepLadies TaoBao Finds,71,ds7189,https://www.reddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/ds7189/two_taobao_hauls_collective_repladies_taobao_finds/,23,1572994349.0,"Hi all - medium time lurker, first time poster! Thanks in advance for being patient if I totally botch this post… I’m a recovering former auth-obsessed shopaholic who took a serious turn in life & got hit with a whole lot of reality and need for practicality. I knew high-quality reps existed, lived in Manhattan for a long time and I had a bougie brandqueen friend from Dallas that introduced me to the back alleys of Chinatown. I bought my first LV rep with her in 2010. I really only thought it was for Chanel and LV type goods. Didn't know how deep the rabbit hole went and my image-obsessed at the time self (ew, I do NOT know her) still was hooked on auths.

Fast forward to 2019: Having been off the lux train for some time now, I randomly caught the bug again, scoured Amazon and impulsively ordered a crappy quality LV off of there. After I ordered it I instantly regretted it and was ready to return it before it even arrived. Knowing that high quality reps exist and not feeling guilty about seeking them out because of the sketch nature of luxury brands, I started scouring the internet. Where do I know anonymous and resourceful internet type stuff exists? Reddit! So, viola, here I am @ r/RepLadies.

After analyzing this sub for a long time, I ended up purchasing a Celine Mini Lugagge from TS Anna (10/10 - would recommend, great bag, great experience, happy to review if people want) via WhatsApp. Then, I learned how to navigate TaoBao/SuperBuy from the FAQs here and YouTube. I have ordered 2 hauls so far off of Taobao via SuperBuy, was lurking here quietly, collecting item in my cart and wishlist based off of content in this sub. I have ordered 2 hauls so far off of Taobao via SuperBuy.

So far, I am most comfortable buying and wearing pieces from brands I already own or have owned, so I can not feel dumb doing QC and also not feel weird carrying them. Maybe one day I’ll get the balls to get a Chanel rep from a TS.

I’ve made a full review of everything I’ve ordered - w2c links, my satisfaction rating and some notes/commentary on why I rated it or why I want it. If you want mod shots or PSPs of anything - please let me know, happy to provide.

I’ve also made a list of everything I’ve got my eye on. I think almost every single one of these items has either been reviewed or mentioned in a post/comment somewhere here over the past two years (yah, I've really been creepin and wading through a whole lot of dead TaoBao links) - I have rounded up my faves and replady staples that I’ve found and loved, but the credit really goes to you guys - I would not have found them on my own, just curating all your reppy goodness. You babes inspire me!

I will update my ordered/warehouse items once I receive.

Let me know if you have any suggestions on my next haul or advice for the goodies currently in my cart! Hopefully this helps someone out!

Here we go….!

|[Tiffany Smile Necklace - Silver](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=564268696579)|10/10|Looks like the real deal, feels like the real deal, I feel confident layering this with my auth Tiffany pieces. The packaging was so good! I compared - there are minor details that are different (coloring, width of font) but they are so small and don't matter unless you are gifting and trying to pass them off as auth|
|[Tiffany Smile Necklace - Rose Gold](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=564268696579)|9/10|Okay - I know the description said rose gold but it looked yellow gold in the pic so I ordered it (I usually wear yellow gold). It's rose gold. Tres cute. All the packaging. Only reason I docked a point was because I don't really wear rose gold. My own fault.|
|[Tiffany Smile Necklace - ""Diamonds""](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=563812293668)|In Warehouse|THREE SMILE NECKLACES LMAO. Another different TB shop. Pls do not judge or ask why I bought so many of these. I couldn't tell you why my squirrel brain does half the things it does. I could've just bought one and saved the rest for an AMQ scarf but here we are.|
|[Saint Laurent Shopping Tote - In Dark Red](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=555899909629)|9.5/10|Yes. Just yes. The leather is great, a little on the thin side, but other than that, perfect work tote for a lowkey flex. I love this  YSL rep because I have a few auths to compare the leather to, so I feel confident carrying this. Leather is equal quality to auth YSL, even though it is thinner. I would buy this again in more colors.|
|[Goyard Tote - White](http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=554991670681)|7/10|Just okay. It's fine as a gym bag but it is really stiff and a bit plasticky. I think the auths look like that too but I am not super familiar and I don't have an auth to compare too. I am not really even a huge Goyard fan to begin with but I was curious at this price. Very passable in a smaller metro city where people will not be able to properly QC in the wild (aka where I live). Y's not all fully touching if that matters to you, but it is really so hard to tell on the white. The Y's seem thicker than auth to me but could just be me being neurotic.|
|[Tory Burch Flats - Burgundy](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=586005525701)|8.5/10|I love these. Points off because the soles don't look like actual TB's at all but it's doubtful anyone will notice. Logo stamping inside the shoes are light. They are very comfortable and made well. I did size up 1 shoe size.Typically I am an 8 (39) but sized up to a 40 and glad I did|
|[Acne Beanie - Navy Blue](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=583452075265)|7/10|Packaging was on point, material was great. Only not at 100% 10/10 because it is way thicker than I expected and looks bulky on me. Big head babes beware. Great quality though. Giving this one to the husband who is becoming increasingly concerned about my shopping habits. If it looked cute on me I would give it a 10/10|
|[CDG Tee Shirt - White Tee / Red Heart](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=528341498795)|9.5/10|I WhenI first opened this I was like wait I don't remember the HeArT LoOkiNG THiS RoUnD.. however, after that initial thought, this is what sold me on reps: I pulled out my CDG shirt and shoes and compared to QC the heart and there is NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL IN THE HEARTS. It is crazy how carefully we are to QC the reps and I didn't blink twice checking quality when buying auths. Tags inside the shirt are slightly lower quality / papery feeling but whoever is up in your shirt tag needs to keep their hands to themselves or just enjoy the ride. Hopefully no one is getting called out by the person taking off their shirt. If so, that's a serious red flag and a story I need someone to post about|

|[Stuart Weitzman Chelsea Boots](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=601140269275)|7.5/10|Pretty good - the soles are very similar to my auth SWs. The stamping inside is messy. I'm not sure how sturdy the quality is yet, but these I would get again.|

143,This movie has clearly been hacked apart.,71,4u8iu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghostbusters/comments/4u8iu5/this_movie_has_clearly_been_hacked_apart/,70,1469285842.0,"Or it's just terribly shot and edited?  Or both?  Feig *has* said the initial cut was 3 hours long, and it shows.

There's been two glaring examples so far, but after the first equipment test in the alley with the *Melissa McCarthy fall down go boom* routine that everyone predicted, it cuts immediately to Patty laughing and then awkwardly asking ""So how'd the two of you guys meet?""

If Abby and Erin are supposed to be friends from school, it doesn't show at ALL.  

You can see hints of what might have been a good movie, but any potential has been edited out in favor of gross out humor and just ... weird improv.

Rowan ... what the hell.  Who is he?  Why should we care?  Why does *he* care?

Did Holtzmann hire a graphic designer to make a professional version of some weird graffiti she saw once in the subway and slap it on the side of the car?  Granted, there was never a scene in the original where they design the logo, but here it just seems glaring.

""Except you girls, I think you can handle it.""  Gone.

Whoa, the sound mix on the concert.  

Shining reference, great.  Room full of nightmares got a laugh.

There is just no sense of tension or dread from seeing a WALKING MANNEQUIN.  That scene could have been terrifying.  It glows red, but then a green dragon ghost comes out when it explodes.  It actually looks like a Gremlin.

Someone else pointed out how they're just haphazardly firing their proton packs down a hallway, PAST EACH OTHER'S HEADS.

Seriously, what is up with the concert sound mix?  ""That's not mine!"" sounds like ADR in a corner instead of a dude screaming over a crowd.

I'm pretty sure that lead singer just got STABBED and hurled into those speakers, yet people are cheering and laughing.

Race thing or a lady thing ... the music and background noise just completely disappears so she can deliver this cringe.  Crowd fades back in after ""punchline""

Why, uh ... why is the demon perched on Patty's shoulder as she's standing up?  Why is the crowd not reacting?  Why did the other three not do anything about it?  Why is any of this happening?

The wide shot reveal got a chuckle.  The second ""I really don't need you to tell me anything"" was unnecessary.

Sound mix still sucks.

Oh hey it's Ozzy Osbourne as himself, the only role he's ever played.

The whole struggle over the name could be funny, but here outside the concert Abby just immediately starts clapping after Erin screams ""We're the Ghostbusters!""  Maybe this could have been, I don't know, an arc for her?  Like, at the end?

Waitresses arguing over who's going to serve Rowan.  We get it.  The guy's an outcast.  Would be nice to know why and how he got here as a person.  Nope, he just mumbles to himself, got it.

Fucking DMX, awesome.  I love ""Up In Here"" as much as anyone, but really?  Helmsworth (damn you Rich Evans) continuing to be the best part of this movie.

Where did they get the money for any of this new equipment?

Bill Murray ... buddy.  What is going through your mind right now?  He literally wanted to do the least amount of work possible.  He was willing to walk for 30 seconds and sit for the rest.

Boo yeah.  Ugh.

Ok, the garbage truck line.  Is that in the script?  Because if not ...

The hat line, if Kevin was already leaning back it might not have broke the flow so much.  Maybe I'm being over critical.

Casper!  Everyone is right, you can hear a glimmer of Venkman in that line delivery.  And then he gets awkwardly thrown out the window.

""That man went out the wrong door"" ... he is also dead.

Patrick Swayze bit, just as awkward in the movie.

Ya know, this movie that's set in New York City ... it almost feels as if it was ... not shot in New York City.  Awkward transition to the Mayor's office.  It should be this huge moment, giant sweeping reveal of City Hall, but no.  

Yes, I know how dreadfully expensive it is to shoot in NYC, but maybe instead of budgeting god knows how much for unnecessary CGI, spend that money on location shoots and practical effects work (like the company which got screwed over by Sony) and make, ya know, a GOOD movie.

Andy Garcia giving an actual performance, amazing.

""You drive a hearse with a ghost on it.""  Hey guys, dry humor!  Amazing!  Can we have 100 minutes of this instead?

""We don't want mass hysteria""  Much different delivery than the trailer.

Every other actor in the room reacting to the cat in a bag routine the way I am, waiting for it to be over.

Another weird scene ending, straight cut from the Mayor's office to ""now the Mayor said we can continue our work ..."" in the alley.  Reshoot?
Cut scene?

Here's a Swiss Army Knife for no apparent reason other than you'll need it in the third Act.

Ghost chipper ... awesome.  We're going Fargo on these fuckers.

The bike flying up into the air still makes no goddamn sense.  And the delivery dude is surprisingly cool about his destroyed property.

Spectral polar bear?  The fuck?

6th and 26th?!  A random address that hasn't been mentioned yet in the movie?  This is important!  Polar bear on 63rd and 5th avenue, ARE YOU LISTENING TO THESE WORDS

Ley lines would have been a great payoff if it was, you know, set up somehow?  Unless you're a crop circle buff you're not going to know what those are.  And that is a shitty X right there.

What if Erin was constantly marking down where the sightings happened and eventually someone noticed they formed an X?  Not suddenly realizing it in a scene at the mention of a random address

... also, uh, West 6th or East 6th?

Holtzmann, fucking dial it down a bit with the rubber face, you're at an 11 right now.

Also, behind Patty in this scene is the window that Bill Murray flew out of, perfectly replaced.  If I'm not mistaken, it's going to be broken again by a possessed McCarthy.  Did anyone think this shit through?  Is there a scene with the window being replaced and a character going, ""Not that window again!""

""It's always the sad pale ones""  Cute.

Forced theme music is forced.

Annie Potts ... oh, Annie Potts.  Why are these cameos so depressing?  It just makes the fact that we got this instead of Ghostbusters 3 that much more painful.

So, Rowan set up this giant series of mechanisms in the basement and nobody noticed?  Who the fuck IS this guy?  Why is he just standing there?  Erin, shut up about pestering, we get it.

""Let's get these barriers destroyed shall we?""  Yes, let's narrate everything we're doing out loud.

This is twice in a row now that Rowan's about to break the barriers and all they do is scream ""STOP!"" and he does.

Jesus Christ, dude just electrocuted himself and they're making jokes.  ""Oh he dead!""  And, was this part of his plan?  He sure seemed like he was about to just break the barriers but I guess suicide was plan B.

Burnt baloney and regrets ... 

What is the Mayor's assistant doing here so fast?

Aw, dig at Eat Pray Love, I wonder what Liz Gilbert thinks about that.  ""Sad sad lonely women"" got cut down.

Can we just take a second and talk about how stupid ""Ghosts of our Past: Both Literally and Figuratively"" is as a title?  It sounds like a South Park version of a Ghostbusters movie.

Rowan draws really well.  He missed his calling.

Pin it to your bra strap, because we're women and the audience might have forgotten.  I realize we're passing the Bechdel test with flying colors here, but come on.

""Hello Abby"" sounded incredibly human for a ghost voice coming out of a sink.

""Ghostbusters, what do you want?"" from Hemsworth might have been funny if we didn't have Annie Potts take the wind out of it a few scenes ago.

Erin calls the office and leaves a voicemail ... no cell phones?  Is that a thing in this movie?  Because there's selfie sticks ... I'm so confused.

In fact, is Erin in a hotel room?  She seems distinctly separated from the group right now, especially since the other three are about to get attacked.  It's almost as if ... they had a falling out ... and Erin is missing at the key moment when her presence might have mattered ... HUH.

Melissa McCarthy playing possessed just a little bit too hard.  Oh hey look this giant pipe, I'll play with it menacingly while Holtzmann makes jokes.

Rowan didn't really think this out, did he?  Let me possess Melissa and just start immediately breaking shit with the other two in the room instead of, I don't know, waiting until she was alone?  Maybe the other two come back while she's destroying shit?  Maybe SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE

Nice low blood sugar joke.  

Rowan calling Patty Patricia ... why, exactly?  Because creepy?

Window broken for the second time.  Awkward action to somehow get Melissa between Patty and Holtzmann. 

Rowan calls her Patty now.  Which one is it?

Devil is a liar line is different.

Hey I wonder if this scene was shot with wires?  Was it shot with wires?  I bet it was shot with wires.  Probably wires.  And hey, I wonder which shots are the set and which shots are exterior on location.  This is like Jack and Jill quality filmmaking.

She seriously slaps the ghost out of Abby.  It's fucking stupid in the trailer and it's even stupider in the movie.

Why is Kevin standing outside asking for a proton pack like there's some big mission he's gotta go off to?  Shouldn't he be, I dunno, answering the phone when Erin called?  

Kevin continuing to talk exactly like Kevin despite Abby being very distinctly possessed.  Bad acting on Chris' part or bad direction on Feig's part?

""That's so not good"" twice, yes Patty, thank you.

Obvious stunt rider is obvious.

The Mayor is confused by a magic trick?  Erin thinks all the windows are sliding doors?  The Mayor's assistant even saying ""That's sad, she's a scientist.""  Come to think of it, what happened to the shot of Erin pulling on a push door?  It's either later in the film or gone.  Was this supposed to be a thing with her character?  She can't door?

Dumpster gag was good, too bad they had to kill it with Erin immediately saying ""It's a dumpster, good""

Jaws reference ... so many references, because comedy.  Andy Garcia continuing to actually give a performance.  ""That took way too long"" was nice lampshading.

""These ghosts kill people!""  They sure fuckin do.

Obvious stunt rider is STILL obvious.

Clark Kent joke, hilarious.  I'm shocked there wasn't a followup ""More like Superman""

""I should have worked out more"" coming from Thor is hilarious.

I don't understand how a series of mirrors breaking and releasing ghosts in the basement triggers a giant CGI cloud over the top of the building, but I'm not a scientist.

Seriously, WHY is Erin all alone?  ""Oh no ... it's happening.""  Yup, sure is, thanks for the narration.

""Alright everyone, run in no particular direction and imagine blue ghosts swirling above ... nope, that's good, cut, I want to go home.""

OH HEY AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF LEY LINES.  

Wait ... why is it night?  IT WAS JUST DAY TIME.  WHY IS IT NIGHT.  It IMMEDIATELY CUTS from a daylight shot of the cloud over the building to a NIGHT TIME SHOT OF GHOSTS COMING OUT OF THE GROUND.  WHAT JUST HAPPENED

Ghost flasher, hilarious.

The fuck, were those ghost roaches coming out of the subway?  Ghost rats?  Because New York?

Oooh a snap zoom on the ECTO-1 license plate.  Nice aborted attempt at an action montage.  ""Oh yeah!"" says Patty in the back seat, continuing to add fuck all to the scenes.

Aw, Dan Aykroyd.  Buddy.  I know you probably thought this was gonna be good.  I know you miss Harold.  We all miss Harold.  But this is just ... ugh.

Why does ECTO-1 have cop bar lights on the back?  Did they miss the whole lecture earlier about breaking every possible federal regulation?

""You guys this looks like my kitchen""  Remember to ALWAYS BE SAYING SOMETHING FUNNY OTHERWISE THE AUDIENCE MIGHT FORGET THIS IS A COMEDY

Not gonna stop Slimer at all?  With your proton packs?  Just gonna watch him get into the car and drive away?

""MAH UNCLE GON BE PISSED""  I'm exaggerating here, but, fucking hell.  Was it too much to ask to give Patty actual dialogue instead of being Token Black Guy from Not Another Teen Movie?

Oh, okay, they did the thing about the car and the reactor and the proton packs.  Still would have come better at a time of actual tension where it might have made a difference and not when he's inside the car driving at them.

Oh hey look the Army is here, because ... Because.  I thought they didn't want a panic?  

Phew, an overhead shot of NYC.  I was forgetting which city this was supposed to be.

Alright, third act giant CGI battle, here we go, woo.

Making eye contact, slightly creepy.

Okay, so, if the ghosts have possessed giant 1920s balloons and they're popping the balloons to destroy the spirits inside, that means that actual 1920s balloons have to physically exist in the real world in order to be possessed, so, did Rowan actually open up some kind of time portal?  Why is any of this happening?  

Crushed by Stay Puft.  There's a joke in there somewhere.

Oh hey it's that thing Erin got earlier in the movie.  What was it, Erin?  ""Sometimes you need the Swiss Army.""  Ah, thank you.

""WELCOME BACK!"" SAYS HOLTZMANN, REFERRING TO AN ARC NO LONGER IN THE FILM.  Why was Erin gone?  Why did she need to be welcomed back?  WHO CARES, ACTION SCENE

""Women, always late."" ... Why was this movie so important for women's rights again?

""Welcome to the glory days of New York City"" but you wouldn't fucking know it with THE GIANT BLURAY BILLBOARD RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FUCKING FACE.  Yes, the transition to old times happens immediately after, but Sony just HAD to get in their product placement and Twinkie reference.

AND despite it now being official old time NYC, there is STILL a giant LIGHT UP SONY BILLBOARD WHAT THE FUCK SONY WE GET IT

Hemsworth awkwardly directing the ghosts' actions from his little set in the corner.

Erin's Jedi tumble is just as fucking stupid in the film as it was in the promotional clip.  

I sure am disappointed I didn't see this in IMAX REAL3D so I could have that blue ghost axe flying directly at my face.

SLAPSHOT

Oh hey Madam Aldridge came back for the third act.

Bit of a laugh with the failed batter up by Abby.

Oh Ghost Demon came back too!  Wait but didn't oh fuck it.

Hemsworth reaction shot from his set, still as detached as ever from the actual action.

Demon got chipped, aw.  All because he sat on Patty's shoulders and caused absolutely no harm to her whatsoever.

Scarface reference, because comedy.  Was that a Wilhelm I heard?  A ghost Wilhelm?

Who, the fuck, exactly is this big lanky monster with the bow tie and hat?  Is he supposed to be a thing?  MORE NEON BLUE GHOSTS

Licking the guns, ugh.  Didn't Abby yell at someone about kissing the equipment earlier?  Why is the inventor licking her guns?

I have no idea what's happening right now.  The orchestral Ghostbusters theme remix wants me to care, but, I just don't.

Yep, those ghosts are fucking dead alright.  Sure hope they weren't tortured souls that had one last piece of business on this planet before they could ascend to a higher plane.

Different take on the ""I'll kick the crap outta YOU and YOU"" or just a later version of it.  It's crazy how much this film changed between trailers and release.  Sigourney Weaver was apparently in the actual film, then cut out completely, then jammed into the credits.

What's, uh, Chris Hemsworth doing right now?  Just standing off to the side on his set, waiting for direction?  You wouldn't know his giant ghost defense force just got demolished in front of him.

HEY WHY Y'ALL LIKE THIS?  Good question, Patty and the audience!  You won't know until the closing credits, apparently!

Slimer and Mrs. Slimer, great.  Driving off into the sunset into the Slimer Cinematic Universe.

So, uh, the thing about them walking into the hotel.  There were two different trailers with two different versions of the reverse shot with the soldiers behind them outside.  One version with them in the dance pose, another with them with their guns pointed at the building, and now in the film it's back to the dance pose.  What the fuck happened in editing?  Was it out of the film completely but left too big of a hole in the narrative and they had to use SOME of it?

Erin just slipped and fell on some slime and ruined any dramatic tension that this moment might have had.  THIS IS A GIANT GHOST MACHINE.

Whoa, I heard those piano keys playing the Ghostbusters theme and had PTSD flashbacks of the first trailer ... guess that wasn't just some shitty attempt at marketing to nostalgia but an actual thing in the movie.

Kevin still talking like Kevin and not Rowan inside Kevin.

Fucking hell, Kevin asks if he's too much like Peter Pan and THEN THERE'S A FUCKING PETER PAN MUSIC CUE WITH SPARKLES.  WHO THE FUCK IS THIS MOVIE FOR?

Why is Erin bobbing her head?  Abby: ""Come on Rowan, come get your virginity out of the Lost and Found!""

Wait.

Hold on.

That would imply he's lost his virginity.  And therefore it would need to be picked up at the Lost and Found.  

Was that ... supposed to be an insult?

""Do those things come with instructions?"" ""You shoot like girls""  Obvious ADR is obvious.  Wait ... WAS THAT STILL KEVIN'S VOICE EVEN THOUGH ROWAN IS NO LONGER INSIDE KEVIN?

Ah, now he's Rowan again, asking ""What form would you prefer I take?""
Great.  Here it comes.

Whoa.  Animated Ghostbusters logo ... I ... what?

How, exactly, does a dead guy have the power to do this?  How is he a God suddenly?  How is any of this?

This is bad.

This is really bad.

Reverse the portal, okay, sure.  If only we had some kind of convenient plot device to come screeching around the corner OH HEY

""Hey, what about that nuclear thing on top of the car?""

Thanks, Patty.

""TOTAL PROTONIC REVERSAL"" says Erin, saying something that would only matter to people in the audience that have seen the original Ghostbusters and means FUCK ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS FILM

""You're a genius, Patty."" ""I'm a Ghostbuster.""  Fuck you.

Wait ... did they just KILL SLIMER AND HIS WIFE?  Ah, no, okay, they're conveniently flying back out of the portal, still wearing their seat belts, in a weird Die Hard 2 reference.  Great.

And.

There it is.

All four of them.

Shoot him in the dick.

With NO reference point or reason to do so, immediately lampshaded by Patty saying ""That's where we were supposed to shoot, right?""

Four distinct burn marks on his crotch.

Fucking amazing.  This has been the best Ghostbusters parody ever.

Where did that tow cable come from, exactly?  See, THIS is what happens when you shoot your big finale entirely on a fucking soundstage with zero practical effects or props to interact with.  Where are we?  Where is any of this happening?  Is this still Times Square or a few blocks away?

Erin doing her best Superman IV: Quest For Peace impression.

This ... what is this?

AND HOW LONG IS THAT FUCKING TOW CABLE?  THEY'VE BEEN FLYING FOR LIKE 30 SECONDS

I WASN'T GOING TO LEAVE YOU TWICE?!  YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ONCE.  YOU NEVER LEFT.  YOU WERE RANDOMLY IN A HOTEL READING A BOOK.

FORCED MOMENT IS FORCED

Oh hey the cable finally snaps back.

...

Wait.

Why ... are the doors closed?  Why are they pulling a tow cable through CLOSED DOORS?

WHY IS THEIR HAIR WHITE NOW

WHY WERE THE DOORS CLOSED

WHY IS IT NOW DAYLIGHT

WHY

IT'S LIKE AFTERNOON RIGHT NOW

2040, our President is a plant.  Holy shit, I think I just laughed.

WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU COME FROM HEMSWORTH?  WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU GET A SANDWICH

I love the Army extras are just awkwardly standing around holding their rifles in the background.  Not, like, scratching their heads or like they just came out of a fucking dance pose they were stuck in for 12 hours.  Like a bunch of actors with no direction.

BABA BOOEY, fuck you Paul Feig

""Now I know how Batman feels.""  

Hair dye joke, Garfield, no, not the cat, the President ... this is humor, folks.  Laugh at it.

The fuck is this speech?  Where is this coming from?

Ernie Hudson, my man, black don't crack.  Flapjacks joke.  Credits.

Fuck.  This.

How much money was wasted on the closing credits CGI?

Now let's jam a bunch of shit that didn't work in the film into the credits.

BASED ON THE 1984 FILM ""GHOSTBUSTERS""?!

FUCK YOU IT IS

Wow they really love that shot of McKinnon licking the gun.

HELLO SIGOURNEY WEAVER.  GOODBYE SIGOURNEY WEAVER.

Aw the CGI city is lit up with Ghostbusters love.  This would have been a great time for Abby to finally accept the name Ghostbusters, but, what the fuck do I know.

Wait ... now it's GHOSTBUSTERS: ANSWER THE CALL?

This dance ...

I feel nothing.

Absolutely nothing.

History will not be kind to this film.

I was just starting with those opening paragraphs but then it devolved into full blown review."

**Here's the story:**

You wake up one morning, dazed and confused (like usual). You go about your morning like you would normally do. While you're eating breakfast (even if you don't, you are now), you see your favorite superhero on TV... In real life... On the news. They just saved some people. You think to yourself, ""Wait, what? How?"" Your thoughts run wild as you begin to wonder what happened.

You brush the event off, you don't want people to think you're crazy, do you? But you're not. You know what you saw. You head to school (college, work, whichever you go to) and when you get there, your friend asks you if you saw the news and how *insert your favorite hero's name here* saved all of those people. That's it, you knew it. You weren't crazy.

Your day goes by fairly normal. You come back home, and there is a therapist there. Wait, what? Who is this person, and why are they at your house? They ask if you've had any incidents today. You ask what they're talking about. They tell you, ""You don't remember? You're still learning how to use your [superpower.](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Random)""

After a long discussion on what's going on, things start to add up and make sense. You're no superhero, but you've got this superpower now. What should you do with it?

You then turn on the news again... Is that your favorite villain (from the same universe as your hero)?

*Did they just... Say your name?*

You are teleported to him, and then you are both teleported to a discreet location. They tell you that you have one job: you **must** take over the world. ""But how,"" you wonder, ""I only have one superpower."" The villain looks at you and laughs. ""You have a second power. The power to *keep what you kill.*""

""Now, go,"" he says. ""This is where your journey begins.""

And, so, you set off. You have a mission. Take over the world. Just you, your powers, and yourself.

*Wait, did you think that was really it?*

You also have your own weapon of choice (make it realistic, something light, something you can carry and maybe hide). You start with $500,000, your weapon, your powers, and your task at hand.

**Before I give you the rules, I'll give you a quick summary if you didn't want to read my beautiful story.**

You wake up in your favorite universe, and are tasked with taking over the world. You start with $500,000, a light, concealable weapon of your choice, and a random [superpower](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Random), plus the power of ""keep what you kill.""

**The rules:**

• This should be obvious, but I'll say it anyway. **Your power may not be omni, meta, total, etc. If your power is OP, re-spin.**

• **You start in the NYC of the world.**

• **You have a backpack that contains your money, and unlimited ammo for your weapon.** You have a holster for your weapon.

• **You will NOT gain anything from killing insects, or living creatures the size of or smaller than rats.** You only gain anything from living creatures larger than your average rat.

• **The money can be spent on anything.**

• **If you hire henchmen, and they kill people, it does NOT count towards your KWYK power.**

Have fun, everybody. :D

148,Four Replies to Unnecessariat,71,e4vfkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/e4vfkd/four_replies_to_unnecessariat/,117,1575270698.0,"[Unnecessariat](https://morecrows.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/unnecessariat/) was a post written in 2016, before the election, describing Deaths from Despair in the midwest, and how they could be fueling modern political drift.  The author believes that an increasing population see themselves as economically unnecessary and socially unwanted, fighting for under the table jobs and completely outside of any serious planning horizons.  By drawing comparisons to past public health crisis and giving the disaster a human face, this presented a level of urgency and seriousness not often covered by mainstream reporters.  While not perfect -- the author conflates a number of issues specific to their situation as a student with general problems, and inadequately separates the new proposed class from similar older classes like the Marxist lumpenproletariat -- it's a well-written and resonant piece, the style of callout that Vox wishes its authors could write, which received a sizable amount of modern coverage for a month and then largely forgotten.

(For Scott's take, see [here](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/23/three-great-articles-on-poverty-and-why-i-disagree-with-all-of-them/); for contemporaneous SSC subreddit discussion, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/4ydjth/the_unnecessariat/); for my own contemporaneous thoughts, see [here](https://gattsuru.tumblr.com/post/144917235919/unnecessariat).)

There's been a few discussions that bring it to mind again, if only because they, whether directly or indirectly, are talking about the same riverbank towns.

The more recent was a concept paper from the **Richmond Fed**, named ""[Cognitive Hubs and Spatial Redistribution](https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/working_papers/2019/wp19-16.pdf)"".  While hard to summarize and very heavy on math, the most charitable summary from its core conclusion is that :

> Our analysis underscores that while CNR (cognitive, non-routine) workers are extremely useful, they are also scarce. Furthermore, their productivity is tremendously enhanced by living with other CNR workers. So attracting them to smaller towns with more mixed populations represents a waste of resources. CNR workers are too valuable for society to be used in this way. A better policy is to reinforce existing trends and let them concentrate in cognitive hubs while incentivizing non-CNR workers to move and help smaller cities grow. Of course, some non CNR workers will always be needed in those hubs because of imperfect substitutability of occupations in production. The result is smaller, more CNR intensive, cognitive hubs in some of today’s largest cities. We show that the resulting migration of non-CNR workers that allows small towns to grow may be implemented with a baseline transfer to non-CNR workers, reminiscent of a universal basic income, and a set of occupation-location specific transfers. Overall, CNR workers transfer resources to non-CNR workers to generate equal welfare gains.

In short, turn the tech cities into big tech or big finance hives, and with your winnings, pay everyone else to get out of the way.  To be fair, that might not even be undesirable in some revealed preference sense: the new outmigratees would be of course voluntary, they show significant population and monetary (albeit not necessary economic: cfe UBI) growth for the tristate area of Unnecessariat, and maybe that's what's necessary.  The paper lives in purely spherical cow land, so it doesn't really have to get into the gritty details regarding how people might live their lives, but they _could_ be better and (according to its projections) does specifically reverse the population and income trends for the southeastern Ohio region, specifically.

Less charitably, it came to my attention summarized as [""Hunger Games gonna happen, isn't it?""](https://web.archive.org/web/20191030151313/https:/twitter.com/Chris_arnade/status/1189555306034073600), in a curiously now-unavailable tweet.  But essentially, it's taken the conclusion of _Unnecessariat_ and doubling down.  Even in the best-case scenario, this emphasis on GPD uber allies comes across as reckless.  The author recognizes that they're skipping over the political and philosophical difficulties of implement a UBI of this scale (>18k USD/non-CNR worker!) when SALT deductions alone have been a huge mess, but the greater fault is that they haven't really considered if it wouldn't work.  There's a good many reasons to suspect discontinuities in workforce relocation, and when people are either stuffing themselves ten to a shoebox or living out of a car in SF, it's not clear any remotely plausible monetary incentive would work.

**Chris Arnade** [has a slightly different focus](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/17/drugs-opiod-addiction-epidemic-portsmouth-ohio):

> Portsmouth, Ohio, once known for making things (steel, shoes, bricks), is now known for drugs, and labeled by some as the “pill mill of America”. The city peaked at 40,000 people in 1940, and as it emptied of factories and jobs – some made obsolete, some moved away – it also emptied of people and hope...

> She is retired after 28 years as a cook in the school system. When I ask if there are drugs around, she laughs. “Oh honey, yes, this is Portsmouth. This is the armpit of Ohio.” She points to the neighborhood. “Everything around here is dope-town. Xanies, Oxys, meth, we got it all. Nothing for kids here. When I was young we had dances at the community centers. Now they have nothing. No work around here unless you are a nurse, or a doctor, or lawyer.”...

> Portsmouth is overwhelmed, and in danger of becoming far worse. It is in danger of becoming a place so saturated with drugs that the shocking becomes normal. It already is a place where people roll their eyes at ambulance sirens, mouthing “another OD”. It already is a place where some men pester and proposition dope-sick women for sex. It already is a place where some kids’ childhoods are traumas to be navigated.

Arnade's written a lot on economic and social misfortunes of what he calls the ""back row"", and while _Dignity_ avoids making policy recommendations and Arnade's twitter posts are hard to summarize, I don't think it's far from [u/Rabitology's post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/e1b9t4/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_november_25/f94bc7b/), mixed with a non-crazy protectionist platform.  Arnade thinks of the Unnecessariat as victims, pushed out from the economy by lopsided trade agreements that [prioritize cheap imports and Chinese investment over worker or environmental parity](https://twitter.com/Chris_arnade/status/1181529345447403522), drowned in addictive pills peddled by the connected, and wedged between a rock and a hard place by state assistance and social disenfranchisement, while vast amounts of state- or state-derived funding is used to lure any potential away.

In some ways, this is a tempting and optimistic (if Manichaen) vision.  Purdue Pharma is someone you could, theoretically, act against and make never happen again, up to and including salting the earth.  Trade deals with China and federal grants are all political questions, not cultural ones.

At the same time, it's incredibly depressing: these are villains that everyone supposedly hates, and haven't beaten or even taken serious moves to strike; it names policies that have been major targets for more than one administration, and haven't been moved to the Senate floor.  Arnade's position doesn't require just the back row to win battles in a political war, but also a [social or cultural one](https://twitter.com/Chris_arnade/status/1185627482197811200), and it's not clear if that's possible by his own framework.  Worst of all, this would be the second (or sometimes third!) generation plagued by addiction, and that we have no plans to cure.  Arnade took a picture of that, [which didn't make it to the final draft](https://medium.com/@ashleybunton/this-is-the-picture-of-the-opioid-crisis-in-ohio-that-no-one-wants-you-to-see-321bddbc7cff).  'James' is 39, addicted to painkillers for twenty years, and while Arnade doesn't tell us his life story, it says something that the hope he has is that his kids don't remember being homeless.  Even if manufacturing came back, even if The Drugs were swallowed by a pit in the ground, even if there's a well-established social network and safety net around, he's not getting his life back.  We don't have the politics for the broad solution to stop new people from being pushed down to that extent, and even if we did, it'd be little salve for the people on the ground Arnade interviews.  But that may be why he's talking about 'less awful' choices.

""No Good Choices"", like many works, received a response [from the community](https://www.portsmouth-dailytimes.com/opinion/16380/please-stop-helping) (aka, a politician, in this case, named **Jason Kester**):

> I have had enough. I’ve had enough of reporters, both national and international, spending a few hours in our community, “diagnosing our issues,” leaving, and then writing outlandish stories about how things are in lowly Portsmouth, Scioto County, and Southern Ohio...

> The reporters also inevitably use a picture of the Sole Choice (formerly Mitchellace) building as an example of an “abandoned factory.” It’s too bad there are 50 people working in there, they have a national marketing campaign about how it’s a shining example of American manufacturing, it houses what we believe to be the only “industrial incubator” south of I-71 in Ohio, and we just graduated our first company out of that space, a Tier-2 automotive parts supplier. There’s really good stuff going on in that building. Of course, the pictures always somehow leave out the multi-million dollar new buildings and development across the street at Appalachian Wood Floors. Coincidence, I am sure.

Kester's ""Please Stop Helping"" is complex piece to read.  The underlying tension between reporting on Deaths of Despair and as outright misery porn fairly well-documented, and the majority of the field is far worse.  (For example, it mentions both ""No Good Choices"" and another piece that is _probably_ ""[The Lonely Women of the Rust Belt](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/05/men-women-rust-belt/525888/)"", and there's a variety of reasons I'm not counting that as a Reply.)  Even those writers that don't go full David Brooks still unavoidably get a more limited and circumscribed view of reality when moved so far from their normal stomping grounds.  Arnade himself doesn't seem to grasp some of the norms biasing his sampling methods (especially given the demographics of southern Ohio); I don't think telling him would actually help.  And while there are plans so technocratic that they don't require boots on the ground, I'm not sure even ""Cognitive Hubs and Spatial Redistribution"" would be in practice.

At the same time, ""Please Stop Helping"" is not really trying to seriously grapple with ""No Good Choices"".  Kester's bafflement about injections to the neck in public is particularly puzzling when there's currently a campaign warning heroin addicts against it, and talks about people doing so when driving rather than the actual description in ""No Good Choices"" of them doing so when parked.  There's a long list of powerful local advocates, covering everything from a county commissioner to the organizer of a Healthy Plate Initiative to a family car dealership to a farmer's market organizer; I don't think any are particularly focused on addiction, chronic unemployment, or homelessness.  His lauded industrial incubator is the [Trinity Business Group](http://trinitybusinessgroupllc.com/), which I'm sure does wonderful things but isn't unique south of i-71 and (perhaps more seriously) is a small two-story building whose industrial equipment is a workstation with a fax machine and whose two linked success stories don't have working webpages.  [Sole Choice Inc's story](https://u.osu.edu/osubusinessdevelopmentnetwork/2017/07/27/sole-choice-inc/) looks more like a hardy survivor than a repeatable business development story, so on.

The eclectic nature of that list of success looks to reflect some local politics, but a broader search doesn't bring up a deep network of advocates or social services: it brings up people working for OSU or federal grants.  His framing of the problem is (ironically) as economics-focused as the Richmond Fed, but even presuming that's the deep issue, Kester just doesn't have the boots when we're talking a labor force participation rate that dropped 15% (and only 58% of prime-working-age men employed), or a medium income household income not far from the poverty line.

**PoiThePoi** is somewhere between rat-adjacent and rat-adjacent-adjacent, who escaped Amazon with only minor injuries but also has had family scattered through (Dem-leaning?) Red Tribe midwestern states, and has an unusual focus on economics as a branch of logistics.  Like Chris Arnade, they're not writing up a Solution, but there's an underlying thread, sometimes predating Unnecessariat, that has a silver lining

> [Yeah, it’s called Meth Country for a reason.](https://poipoipoi-2016.tumblr.com/post/168543320852/raw-sewage-hookworm-and-civil-rights-un-official) It’s not just the South (though the South might be worse, because the winters and summers are survivable in a busted-up trailer), it’s everywhere 20 minutes outside of a major metro area... There are functional places, we’ve just made it illegal (or sufficiently expensive that there’s no difference) to move there...

> [The South will look at their competitive advantage (Affordable 3BR exurban houses so you can actually have kids), the heat/humidity issues, and double down on air conditioned congestion boxes.  The Midwest?  That could get interesting.](https://twitter.com/poiThePoi/status/1061092184395579393)

> [RE: why small Midwestern cities aren't growing] Because the Midwest as a whole isn't absorbing population fleeing the failures of SF/NYC/etc like the Sun Belt.  It's absorbing bright rural kids from the Midwest, but not much else.  And they're running out of those kids.  /This could change, of course.

> [B) 90% of it is completely screwed in the new economy.  It’s not even farms, it’s these random warehouses by the side of the road 20 miles out of Lancaster, PA that have no reason to exist in 2018.](https://poipoipoi-2016.tumblr.com/post/174778473222/maybe-maybe-its-a-gamble-and-you-think-youll)  At least not in these numbers. ( C) Based on domestic migration stats, we’re actively pushing people off the lifeboats).  

> [But the simple fact of the matter is that moving to SF is worth a 70% payraise and the only way to keep Youngstown, Ohio from evacuating to SF is to keep the rents high enough that a 70% payraise costs you money.](https://poipoipoi-2016.tumblr.com/post/157254628262/population-should-be-factor-in-housing-discussion)

> [And it’s been terrible for their residents](https://poipoipoi-2016.tumblr.com/post/155050059562/from-collapsedsquid-there-are-more-serious).  Seattle rents went up $3,000 last year (To wit: $75K annual income/40pct rent/income/10pct annual increase).  Unless the average resident got a $5,000 wage increase (Boo taxes), the average Seattle resident had a falling standard of living.   Until one day, they give up and take a $25,000 paycut to move to Dallas.  Or Cleveland. Because I’ve been in Silicon Valley for 4 years and my rent tripled while my commute quadrupled.  So I’m trying to GTFO because I’m done June 1st*.
 
Despite a similar mathematical model as the Richmond Fed framework, Poi comes to a nearly opposite conclusion: while CNR concentration may increase GDP, for goofy policy reasons the as-applied versions is absolutely awful for even the more successful workers in smaller companies, and the extent it hasn't [crashed bigger companies yet is simply because they're further down the pipeline](https://twitter.com/poiThePoi/status/1027970993434845184).

Unless the coasts fix their housing models (hah), this suggests that we'll be seeing increasing outmigration from the coasts to the 'hinterland' cities.  While they may not head to Portsmouth, they'll at least not be on the far side of a mountain range and/or desert.  Unnecessariat worried about these individuals moving back, but in the understanding that they'd be turning farms into vacation homes or hobby farms, as is currently the focus.  But if they're actually living there, integrated (or at least in a normal gated community), this will necessarily involve some number of surrounding service jobs, and some manufacturing that made sense when sitting on the main ports to China might not be worth it for younger startups now that Chinese wages are increasing.

The downside, of course, is that the sudden collapse of the Bay Area startup scene and housing market might make people long for an earthquake instead.  There's no guarantee that this reversion might happen in a year, or a decade, or a generation, and even once it does, Poi still expect most of the midwest to end up stagnated or cannibalized by Chicago.  And even more than Arnade's approach, the best-case scenario here is unfriendly for the Deaths From Despair generation : not only would tech startups moving in be unlikely to hire James for anything more complicated than sweeping floors, the conflict of social norms and expectations would be _rough_.  Those social norms might favor more spending on government-provided social services, but they haven't worked great for California so far.

**Which leaves the broader questions:**

* Which, if any of these, might even be describing the problem correctly?  Though not necessarily incompatible, they're highly unlikely to all be right, and some do have tastes of just-so stories.

* I've brought up 'James' occasionally, as an example of someone on the Despair side without the Deaths, but while he's an extreme version, we're talking more than a full percent of the state population; most estimates put more than 2% of the population as being moved to SSDI full-stop.  Is this the sorta thing that just ends up an awkward part of the graveyard no one talks about?  Does anyone have a plan for [when a significant portion of a generation is raised by their grandparents](https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-grandparents-raising-grandkids-20181008-story.html)?

* What do you do about migration?  Even Kester's policies, the most highly localized pieces, are still dependent on labor mobility, but at the same time, the situation for many of these workers ties them down heavily, either by policy or prospect.  Even Poi and Arnade's solutions have depopulated areas, where people need to sell to move away, and there's no one that would want to buy."
149,I believe that there should be a Fallout game in New York. Here's why.,74,gad2rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/gad2rh/i_believe_that_there_should_be_a_fallout_game_in/,72,1588179447.0,"First of all, let me start with this image: You are scrolling through YouTube, or watching TV one day, and all of a sudden, a trailer pops up with the image of a busted up radio. The piece of pre-war tech crackles harshly, and this song starts [wheezing out of the blackened speakers](https://youtu.be/EUrUfJW1JGk)

The song starts up tiny and grainy, but as the camera slowly pulls away to show the scarred streets of a city, the hollowed out shells of Taxis littering the streets, and the shadows of people who were vaporized in atomic blasts decorating the walls of decrepit buildings.The song starts to pick up, and have a life of it's own, as the camera pulls up to show the chipped skyline of the biggest, most iconic city in America. Most importantly: The lights. Are. On. The song hits a crescendo, and suddenly you see it all. Flashes of a broken city that has been flooded with feral ghouls, mafiosos, tribals, dangerous plant life, toxic clouds, hideously distorted zoo life, and wastelanders in stained jumpsuits living in slums or working on scaffolding. The scene moves past a wall, and it shows cleaner streets, working taxis driven by robco automatons, people walking up and down the streets in fancy clothes, and televisions in windows that display cartoons of vault boy, talk shows, and the news.

New York city. No place has ever personified the American Dream more than The Big Apple. And now here it stands, scarred and beaten, but still humming with power, even centuries after the bombs fell. Somewhere in this city is a promise, an idea, that you can make something out of yourself in the big city. Become rich, famous or powerful. Only in this new age, that means something entirely different.

NYC is more than a place, it is also an idea. Anyone can succeed. Anyone can be great. Even the bombs couldn't erase that. It is after all, the city that never sleeps.

*Ahem* Okay, now that I've got the premise out of the way, let me hit you with some facts on why EXACTLY this would make a godly location for the next Fallout:

-NYC has the highest Chinese-american population in the United states (This matters because China was at war with America before they nuked each other to pieces) NYC could be FANTASTIC for sidequests, lore rich locations, and places to find stealth suits (hidden in the homes of spies or Chinese sympathisers)

-NYC is pest central. It is filled with rats, cockroaches, termites, squirrels, raccoons and pigeons, which could all make for great fodder enemies, and could even benefit from some more creative variety among their species. How about flying Radroaches? Or Radroach queens the size of taxis?(I know bethesda thought about it. They had a cartoon version of one in the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Luck short) how about Radroach nests that are essentially buildings that have been morphed into great hives over the span of decades?
Giant rats could fill the sewers, along with mutated turtles. (Yes, turtles, and tortoises are native to NY. It would actually make sense.) NY is also likely to have crocodiles in it's sewers, so there could also be mutated giant sewer lizards as well. Hell, it could be a great location for gatorclaws.

-New york is famous for organized crime. It was especially bad in the 80's. Imagine if there was a faction of former raiders who were pulled under the leash of one brutal kingpin that created a force more reminiscent of the italian mob. The raiders you fight in the city aren't drugged out loonies running around in pajamas, and armor that they pulled off of mailboxes, these people are heavily armed, organized, well dressed, and are much harder to stop than common bandits, because they are likely to have a hand in the governing forces that might exist in the city. They don't try to take the player on in a hoarder of screaming humanity. No. They would send a team of elite hitmen in disguise to gun you down with submachine guns the second you turn your back. Hell, imagine if you could join a faction like that.

-NYC is shown as the background for dozens of talk shows. Imagine if television broadcasting were brought back to the wasteland in the city, and you could see the talk show host talking about current events, and interviewing people on tv,  just like you could hear radio show hosts from every other game doing so on your pip boy. Hell, what about a sidequest where you get interviewed on air? And people point you out as ""that guy on TV"" on the streets.

-NYC is also home to fort Hamilton, a military base that could easily be home to a faction that is set on either conquering or defending the city.

NYC is the classic battleground between the upper and lower classes. It would be the perfect place to decide if the player would rather be a man/woman of high society, or a person who sticks up for the working man's rights.

New York city has the nickname ""the concrete jungle"" what if the devs made this into a much more literal term? Imagine a section of NY that had been violently reclaimed by nature mutated by radiation, FEV, or an agriculture experiment gone wrong? What kinds of enemies would fill that area? Mutated zoo animals? Tribals descended from Native americans?(that would make an awesome faction) Which part of the city would it even be in? Would central park have grown out of control to consume the surrounding cityscape? 

NYC is home to the federal reserve vault. That is 200 billion dollars worth of gold, buried 2 stories underground in a vault in manhattan.

NYC has the largest population of millionaires in the world. How many of them would have built their own shelters to escape the fallout, or madly threw their fortunes into creating a means of immortality like House, or John Caleb Bradburton?
 
NYC is one of the most important trade hubs in America. Historically speaking, it's pretty much responsible for creating the American economy as we know it. What if wastelanders could gather enough resources to internationally trade again? Should they?


Personally, I think that those traits alone would make it a fantastic location for the next fallout. It has the resources to remake the world the way it used to be, but   it would also be a challenging, and dangerous environment rich with history and character. Plenty of factions would try to fight over that city for control, people would get caught in the crossfire, and all around the player is evidence of what happens when too much power is held in mankind's hands. (You ARE in a blasted, post-nuclear hellscape)

Another thing it has: stakes.
 NYC is the beating heart of the American dream. What would happen to America if it was wiped from the map? It would be a loss beyond simple words. 

What are your thoughts? What do you want to see in the next fallout game? What would make for good gameplay mechanics in New york? Or good quests?

To preface - all information involving the NYCC 2020 AKA Funko Virtual Con 4 AKA Calculating Shipping Rates 4 Revenge of Princess Unicorn release rolled out from 9/14 - 9/21. I will be working to continue to update this post as additional information becomes available all the way up till the date of the release (10/8/2020).

This year's Funko.com virtual con drop will be a lottery system. Please read the entirety of the Funko blog post linked above to ensure you are successfully signed up for the lottery.

## Your 2020 New York Comic Con (AKA FUNKO VIRTUAL CON 4) Funko Information Guide

The VIRTUAL New York Comic Con is currently set as October 5th - October 10th. There will be no physical con happening this year. As such, all con exclusives will be available online and through shared retailers. Based on past information they should become available to pre-order/purchase sometime between October 4th - 11th. This thread will collect the official announcements from Funko only (usually linking to their official Twitter announcements as a rule of thumb) and will serve to collect the information about each revealed wave of exclusives. I will not be collecting leaked shared locations or pops as this will only serve as a thread to collect officially announced information. Some info will be leaking throughout the reveals but you can check back here when they are officially confirmed.

155,The Hardcore-Casual Player and Stardust Investment; Balancing Payoff vs Risk for Stardust Investment in a Volatile and Ever-Changing Meta.,65,5vfgh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/5vfgh2/the_hardcorecasual_player_and_stardust_investment/,53,1487724085.0,"This is not a mathematical or statistical analysis of what I think you should do with your dust, but is more of a discussion about low-risk stardust investment and being a ""hardcore casual"" player in MMOs in general. I think this is extremely pertinent right now after the major gen 2 update and subsequent (and imo inevitable) re-balancing, especially given that many people here would not have played MMOs before. I think my points still stand regardless of whether or not you consider this game an MMO; I don't think it's worth it to argue over definitions. This post became rather long, but the main point is that there definitely exist safe, low-risk investments; **some Pokemon will ALWAYS be good, or at least ""worth sticking in the top half of a gym"", regardless of meta, movesets, or formulae.**


If you are a hardcore player or a whale, these changes likely don't matter; you will have millions of stardust either stored or will grind some quickly to make a new perfect army and get to show it off before everyone else does once again. If you do not care about the numbers behind the Pokemon or any rankings/tier lists, this also won't really matter, as you just want to power up your favourite Pokemon simply because they are your favourite or they are cute (etc.); I imagine these people are not browsing this forum, but we must remember that MANY people like this exist and they are probably going to be the (perhaps overwhelming) majority.


######**The Hardcore-Casual**

This post is for those somewhere inbetween, leaning more to the hardcore side but definitely not all the way; the ""hardcore casual"" crowd. This is me, and I wager also many (perhaps most) people in this sub. They can tell you all about IV's and formulae, are reading up on the news/analysis multiple times a day, and have near-memorised the type chart, the tier lists, and relative percentage strengths. Crucially, however, these players do not play as much as the hardcore crowd, for a multitude of reasons, often some combination of work, family, studying, practicality, or simply willpower. But when we do play, we want to play it ""right"" (i.e., optimally). In MMOs, these are the players most likely to be burned by sweeping changes because their carefully crafted investment is rendered suddenly obsolete or needs significant rethinking.

I played WoW since its release for roughly 7 years (until Firelands, Cataclysm), but ultimately due to my IRL commitments and the direction the game was going, I could simply no longer keep up with the top tier players who had the time that I didn't, so I quit. I still love the game, get chills watching Paragon's world first Heroic 25 Lich King kill video, and am fascinated by the mechanics of newer content, but I simply cannot invest the time required to be a top level player. This is the tragedy of the hardcore-casual player; at some point, after some threshold or level of tolerance, you just have to call it quits. If you don't want to quit or burn out because like me you love collecting/fighting Pokemon, then before this happens you need to carefully evaluate what you want out of the game and whether or not you are actually able to achieve it.


The ability for a hardcore-casual player to remain relevant in PoGo depends heavily on where you live. If you live in NYC or anywhere ridiculously dense and competitive, I imagine it can be difficult and you need to carefully carve out your niche. If you live in the middle of nowhere, it is going to be hard to even get Pokemon reliably. I think I'm quite lucky where I live; I won't bore you with the details, but it is a well Pokemon-populated suburbia with a relatively calm local gym meta, with a single spawn point on top of my house, albeit basically no Pokestops. However, I doubt that I will call it quits anytime soon since I absolutely LOVE Pokemon and have relatively easy access to specific locations with an incredible variety and volume of Pokemon. Others will not be so lucky. As a result, this type of player must - in my opinion - make very cautious investments; not too cautious, but not too rash. It makes me equally sad seeing people with 5M stardust hesitant to even do ANYTHING as it does when people transfer their powered up ""formerly-niche now-trash moveset"" Pokemon, only for the moveset to be top tier again literally days later.


My main message for you is to take a cautious, measured approach. This is easier said than done; when you get a current top tier Pokemon and/or moveset, it is sometimes impossible to resist the temptation to power it up. Our brain loves the reward from (no condescension intended, it's in our nature) ""hitting the shiny button to make the numbers go up"", myself included. This is made even harder if the Pokemon is a favourite of yours (although, if you really love a Pokemon from the main series, you may well power it up regardless of any tier lists). Sadly, many of these Pokemon/movesets are simply ""Flavour of the Month"" (FotM) and will come and go, sometimes quite dramatically. Crucially, the opposite is also true; some Pokemon will remain at or near the top of rankings regardless of what Niantic does (outside of some absurd or nonsensical formula changes where suddenly Rats and Hoothoots are the best). This is, in my opinion, where the hardcore-casual player needs to focus, because you do not risk having your investment go up in flames due to balancing (or sometimes, even a slight tweak).

######**Specific Pokemon**

Depending on how much you know from the main series, there are some stardust investments that are definitely and unquestionably worth it, regardless of essentially any other factor. Pseudo-legendaries like Dragonite, Tyranitar, and in the future Metagross [Gen 3], Salamence [3], Garchomp [4] etc., along with other well known specialised giants such as Snorlax, Blissey etc. will ALWAYS be at or near the top purely due to the nature of their base state distribution; either tanky powerhouses or super tanky with a decent Atk/Sp. Atk stat). Their exact ranking position will change as balance changes are made and new Pokemon are introduced, but ultimately unless you fetishise about absolute 100% perfection (which I believe really can't as a hardcore-casual), you won't be burned by investing wisely because for a long time, these mons will feature near or at the top of tier lists.

As we have seen with the introduction of Gen 2, the previously best Pokemon were not simply made redundant by fresh blood; the various ""tiers"" of Pokemon strength were simplified filled out, adding more variety and increasing the chance that players get one. Clearly, not everybody has a Dragonite or a Snorlax (I've one Dragonite and no stardust worthy Snorlaxes), but there are still other Pokemon that will remain ""at least pretty good"" regardless. My main point is that unless Niantic do something completely absurd, regardless of whatever rules or formulae they decide to use, Pokemon like Dragonite, Snorlax, Blissey, and Tyranitar will never be completely useless. Yes, I know that Alakazam and Gengar are also well known main-series specialised giants, but they are glass cannons rather than brick walls and so are not intended in any universe to sit at the top of a gym.

The reason, I think, that people feel burned is because accepted specialised niches were heavily invested into and then nerfed so they were no longer FotM, leaving people annoyed that their top 5 ""diversity"" mon is now not as good. This would be like Blizzard suddenly buffing Elemental Shamans, people rerolling this as their main character, and then Blizzard nerfing them again and leaving them nerfed and non-competitive for months. I'm still slightly bitter over the fall of Poliwrath and Slowbro, but I now realise that they were barely hanging on to the bottom of the ladder for very specific reasons, and all it took was one small push for them to drop. They are still very good pokemon, but their CP leaves them non-competitive. Here are a few very general and non-exhaustive classes of Pokemon right now:

- Gyarados, Vaporeon, Arcanine, and Exeggutor are likely to survive most iterations of balance due to their stat distribution leaving them quite/reasonably tanky on top of their high DPS, but others below are not as robust.

- Pokemon like Alakazam and Gengar are glass cannons, which could (and in this case, have!) flip between literally top tier and literally garbage based on the fine tuning of the CP formula, what moves they have, and how these moves behave. Many people have invested in these mons as they are (quite rightly) fan favourites, but they are first in line to get burned by even minor tweaks. Hence, not a wise priority for long term safe/""competitive"" investment.

- Pokemon like Rhydon rely on the CP formula and was suddenly projected into the spotlight because of the CP formula change and it's [very specialised stat distribution](https://i.gyazo.com/53fbca78eaae5a01fe5f9d562deb11da.png). If the weighting of Atk and Sp. Atk that feed into the ATT formula in PoGo changes even a little (which is pretty much inevitable, imo), Rhydon will take a notable hit. Hence, Rhydon is a moderately risky long-term investment and should not be first on anyone's list as a result. This is not to say don't max one out, because currently it IS a monster for how easy it is to get vs. other 3k CP mons, but perhaps do so after considering other options first.

- Pokemon like Machamp, despite having great stats, went from useless to amazing simply by balancing/changing its moves. Certainly a risky investment and one that, more than others, involves carefully considering potential future balancing.

- Special mention to Lapras, who was amazingly left unnerfed for a long time for no logical reason other than the strange Lapras event in Japan. I powered mine to level 30 a long time ago and left it there and I think it was a mistake for others to invest so much time into it, but at the same time I'm annoyed at Niantic for leaving this one special case that could (and did) change drastically with no warning. That said, people around here should have seen this coming; it was well discussed as the single notable exception to the CP formula update and clearly it would fall in line eventually.

- Porygon 2: This Pokemon is currently ranking highly on various lists, which is great, but **it evolves in gen 4 so its moves will be rerolled again when you do so**. Porygon 2 is quite good and Porygon Z could be quite powerful indeed, but unless you absolutely love this Pokemon, be very vary of deep investment at this time.


######**Potential Future Changes (Opinion)**

The true travesty in PoGo (ignoring discussion on any gameplay elements) is (1) Pokemon like Kingdra, Steelix, and Umbreon; (2) type effectiveness multipliers.

(1) These Pokemon were major main series players for many generations (with some use in multiple meta forms even now, 5 generations on). Steelix and Umbreon are brick walls/supports on par with Snorlax and Blissey, but whose strength lies in their defense stats rather than their HP. Kingdra is the ultimate all rounder with amazing typing and access to fantastic combinations of abilities and moves, but also with less HP than others.

(2) Exploiting type effectiveness and building a type-balanced team is one of my favourite things in the main series, but this is completely absent outside of niche cases like Dragonite and Gyarados in this game. Niantic will definitely continue to iterate the CP formula (this should be obvious), but I also fully believe that Niantic will change the type effectiveness multipliers at some point (although probably not to the x2 and x4 (etc.) of the main series), as well as fundamentally rebalance all Pokemon's HP by giving them all some kind of flat HP boost, like in the main series. This will obviously require further move damage/speed rebalancing. Both of these changes will make more and more Pokemon useful in their own way, but regardless of what happens, go with the safe investment first.


######**Summary**

**Don't board the hype train and burn all your resources on a niche use Pokemon/moveset in the process.** Go with whatever option is safest (substantially helped by main series knowledge) or whatever you enjoy. I maxed out my 96% Kingdra since it rolled Dragon Breath/Outrage and it's one of my favourites. Definitely not the best use of dust, but at least it can always be used as a safe yet powerful prestiger against high level (2700-3100) Vaporeon.

**What is this?:** This is a weekly feature designed to highlight the unknown/underappreciated groups and soloists working hard in the Kpop world that often fall under the radar. Please share your own information, favorite performance videos, fanmeet stories, or anything else relevant below!  [Last week we dove into Dreamnote](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/eubfaa/nugu_roundup_25_pretty_girls_ringing_danger_200126/), this week, since it's Super Bowl Sunday, let's have a Kpop Snuper Bowl!  

**What is Nugu?:** While in Korean it literally means 'Who' in the broader Kpop context it refers to groups that are generally unknown amongst the greater public. It doesn't have to mean they're extremely new, though it can, and there are of course varying degrees of 'unknown' which some groups having very strong niche fandoms and others being almost invisible. I take a fairly broad view and will include groups that may be known to some, but who don't have widespread name recognition.

**And now, on to the show....**

**Snuper**

**Who are they?:**  Snuper is a 6-member boy group under Widmay Entertainment, the company's first group.  Their name stands for ""Higher than Super"" and according to the group represents their desire to come together with their individual strengths to become greater than individual Supermen.  They have also said that it shows a duality in their nature, with the name's similarity to Snoopy showing their cute and loveable side, but also hinting at a cool and intense Super nature. 

**Company:** Snuper is the only group under Widmay Entertainment, though they also represent actor Ahn Il Kwon.

**Debut:** November 16th, 2015 with Shall We Dance ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lMLjW6TeHM)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgQFmqWauXI)) From their debut EP ""Shall We"".  Upbeat synth-driven pop produced by Sweetune (who have worked on a number of Snuper songs, and who are known for their work with K-ARA, Lovelyz, Infinite, 9Muses, SPICA, and more).  

**Most Recent Comeback:** August 8th, 2019 with Come Over ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaBihGOEZUI)) (Japanese Release) and October 8th, 2018 with You In My Eyes ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tUaHSN7Kf0)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMTV-PFp628)) (latest Korean release) You In My Eyes is actually a re-release of a B-side from their Blossom EP, that was selected as a new title track via a Makestar fan poll.  This one was composed by Obros, who have worked for Astro, JBJ/Kim Dong  Han, UP10TION, and Lucente and who also composed the title track for Snuper's Blossom EP.

**Other MVs and Live Stages**

* Platonic Love ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJLYikmDoIM)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELL_pO3eeM)) Another Sweetune song, this one is heavily '80s New Wave influenced in both music and MV visuals.
* It's Raining ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SkvOluCbtI)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvS0Xl24Ijs)) A dark dance-pop song with some hints of retro synths and disco influence.  The members expressed a desire to showcase a more mature and sexier side of themselves with this release.
* You=Heaven ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gnp8zAk3NbM)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBRSMyc0lVo)) Continuing with their Sweetune collaborations this one has a great fake-out intro that starts off as a ballad before transitioning into an upbeat summery retro-yacht-pop number.  Some fun harmonic motion towards the end really elevates this one.  
* Oh Yeah! ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3ycysDcWkY)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W1GqqSSHk8)) This is their first Japanese single.  It's light airy pop.
* Back:Hug ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTRIFs1CodM)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqH-IR4vWN8)) Sweetune's trademark '80s synth meet EDM and Tropical House influence viewed through the lens of a harder boy-band track for this one, the end result being slightly disjointed but unique and intriguing.  
* The Star of Stars ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpYFo860wA)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv7mzLhwOH8)) From their repackage of their 'I Wanna' EP (the one who's title track was Back:Hug) this one goes full-bore into the tropical house genre, but comes across as more cohesive and polished because of it.
* Dear ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sJf0_7AddM)) A special track released for their 2nd anniversary, minimalist production lets the vocal shine in this '90s R&B influenced ballad.  
* Stand By Me ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHXPRm_0y3U)) Their 2nd original Japanese single.  Snuper's popularity was starting to soar in Japan at this point and this song is solidly in the 'Jpop for the Jpop market' category musically.
* Natsu no Magic ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwGW5NC7pY)) Another Japanese release, this one being summery and bright with some fun latin percussion.
* Tulips ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onqSAgAqpLQ)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGq1uvcC-0Q)) Snuper's first foray away from Sweetune for a Korean release, this is their first Obros-penned release.  The retro flair that had become the hallmark of their previous work is gone, and in its place a pretty typical EDM/R&B boy band track.
* Weekend Secret ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdiG2r4hUQk)) Their 5th Japanese release, this one paradoxically comes across as their most western-sounding song, feeling like it would fit perfectly in the discography of modern EDM pop groups.

**Trivia:** Snuper's fandom name is 'Swing'.  They've been more popular in Japan than in Korea, having reached #2 in the Japanese ORICON chart, possibly because of having a half-Japanese member and two members fluent in Japanese.  They faced a little bit of controversy from VIXX fans who thought their stage outfits from their ""It's Raining"" promotions were too similar to VIXX stage outfits.  Member Taewoong [was attacked by an eldery woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05tnTQ44s78&feature=emb_logo) while the group was busking during their Star of Stars promotions, apparently she felt their presence was disrupting her business.  Snuper has toured in Canada, the UAE, Russia, Mexico, and possibly other countries.  A number of staff members who had previously worked with Miss A moved to Widmay to work with Snuper.

* I Like It ([digital music link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBRE4B-k_7g)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8VKe5wI0-g)) I Like It was selected for the group by their CEO, and while they originally didn't like it, the positive public response to it changed their minds.  It was written by the same songwriting team responsible for SNSD's Genie.  
* One More Day ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjnIoQFhEN0)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5t9mgDdhjM)) Featuring sexy chair choreography and a rap feature by Hyu Sung Ram of hip-hop Duo X-CROSS this was the 2nd promoted single from their I Like It EP.

**Reasons for Disbandment:**  According to Melanie Lee in a [great Kpopalypse Interview](https://www.asianjunkie.com/2017/04/15/interview-melanie-lee-chocolat-on-disbanding-the-k-pop-industry-and-mental-health/), the company never seemed to know exactly what to do with the group.  They launched them with the tag of being the first mixed-race Kpop group, but at many points tried to get to downplay the non-Korean parts of themselves, along with asking the group for their input and then telling them their opinions were wrong.  They were met with some negative responses initially due to their mixed-race nature, but the public was seemingly more open about it than their company believed.

Also as always, a big shout-out to [u/not-named-in-credits](https://www.reddit.com/u/not-named-in-credits/) for his amazing work with [r/nugutown](https://www.reddit.com/r/nugutown/)."
157,Stuart Little fact #767 NYC street rats preparing the demonic resurrection of Stuart Little,63,apbztp,https://i.redd.it/ixi578tsyuf21.jpg,0,1549855564.0,

This New York times story shows one snap shot of discrimination against Asians based on racial stereotype (specifically, the Chinese living in NYC, referred in the story as ""Chinamen"" or ""Mongolian"") in the 1880s.

Almost nothing has changed in the span of a century: the Chinese in the white mind went from eating rats and cats to eating dogs. This story shows how deeply these stereotypes are embedded in the western, white psyche.

Nonetheless, from the story, you get the sense that the methods of resistance used by Asians against discrimination in the 1880 is not so different from that of today's, and there is still much we can learn from them.

&#x200B;

**Excerpt**:

*Do the Chinese eat rats? This has always been a mooted question. Geographies contain the assertion that they do, and an old wood-cut of a Chinaman peddling rodents, strung by the tails to a rack which he carried over his shoulders, is a standard illustration of the common school atlases of 10 years ago.*  *A large portion of the community believe implicitly that Chinamen love rats as Western people love poultry*

*...*

*Wong Chin Foo, the editor of the Chinese-American, yesterday offered a reward of $500 for any one who could prove that a Chinaman ate rats or cats. Chung Kee was very indignant. and told the reporter in very emphatic pigeon English that he intended to sue Dr. Kaemmerer for slander.*  *Wong Chin Foo said that he had traveled all over China and had never heard of a native eating a rat or a cat.*

...

*He (Wong Chin Foo) had never heard of the rat story until he came to America. There were no necessity for the Chinese to eat such food here, he said,*  *as they were all making money. Laundry hands receive $3 a day and their board, and some exceptionally good workmen get as high as $5. They can all afford to buy the best that the market affords.*

[What made you do an AMA now?(Your account is three years old already :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6flhvn?context=5)|I did one AMA (on video) a few years back.  I've been wanting to do one for awhile. Also: we have a season Premiere on the 7th of this month. New time- 8pm on Discovery. Now if you don't mind I'd like to get back to answering only questions about Woody Harrelson's movies.
[What is the funniest thing Jamie has ever said?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fl2y8?context=5)|I can't repeat it here. Jamie has a dark dark sense of humor.
[Mr. Savage, what is your best/worst fan experience in real life? Huge fan of the show. You guys blow my mind!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fko29?context=5)|Having people yell my name really loud in airports is a low point (why people need to yell about meeting me is beyond me- it feels super aggressive). Meeting any kids is always a high point.
 |Whenever people yell ""Jamie"" I don't respond. It feels weird correcting them and at the worst they're going to think that Jamie's a jerk. 
[What myth requested by a fan was so far-fetched and absurd that it was practically laughable? And if you ever find the opportunity to test out the myth, how would you go about busting it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fknik?context=5)|Several times we've gotten suggestions that we thought were like that but eventually figured out a way to do them: like punching sharks. The first guy to suggest that (was totally drunk btw) sounded full crazy to me.  A year later we were in the Bahamas punching sharks.
[Could you do a Mythbusters episode where you de-bunk the ""scientific"" equipment and methods used by people who claim to be Ghost Hunters?  Either that--or could you build a Proton Pack?  Please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkxgg?context=5)|They do that themselves by never coming up with a positive (non subjective) result. We don't need to complicate things by starting to try and prove negatives on the show. That's not our business. 
[What do you think is the largest hurdle for Humanity right now? And how can we overcome it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkpbt?context=5)|The corrupting influence of money in politics. It's getting worse. Publicly funded elections is one solution. It's not an easy problem to solve but it needs solving. That's what's on my mind lately. Bill Gates is taking care of the rest. 
[What were the most difficult myths to pitch to Discovery that did/didn't end up on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkpe7?context=5)|They love almost everything we bring them. They shut down very few stories. But they hate the Hi-Fidelity myths that I want to do: Vinyl vs. CD vs. MP3. We'll wear them down eventually.
[What's your least favorite part of testing a myth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkodu?context=5)|The blueprints that open and close the show. Those stilted conversations are hard to keep fresh. If you watch a lot of them, you'll notice we try lots of things to keep them from being stale, but they take a lot out of me. I'd much rather do my camera stuff in the moment. 
[I can feel your pain thru the screen (Jamie's too\) when you have to do these ridiculous scripts for those...also my least favorite part...jump right in!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6flz66?context=5)|It's the convention that's tough, we do the best we can. For the record, I write most of those scripts.
[What does your wife think of the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkndk?context=5)|Favorite color is Orange.

[I love that you're a strong advocate for allowing people to make mistakes when they're learning anything new. It's a sentiment that really hits home, especially as I get older.  Finally - is it weird that people ask you to come to events, stand up and talk about stuff you like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fknc2?context=5)|It's a great and (temporary) thing that people want to ask me about what I do. I will miss it when they stop. I'm grateful and humbled that us farting around in the shop has had such long lasting resonance. It's humbling.
[If you were stranded on an island i the middle of the ocean, what three items would you want to have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkppr?context=5)|Leatherman. Duct tape. A tarp. Baling wire. A spoon. Some rope. Oh, and a trailer and some food.
[What myth did you think was totally going to get busted but it did not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkna7?context=5)|Killer Cable snap. The myth that a cable under tension can slice through you when it snaps and whips around. . Not a fisherman alive who doesn't KNOW that this is true. Except that it isn't. We busted it wide open. I was very surprised. But our research bore that out: we found not a singe first person account of it happening. Everything was circumstantial. 
[What's the worst suggestion for a myth to bust the show has ever gotten?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkqvd?context=5)|Old (often drunk) dudes who ask me myths about them dating Kari. I know she's lovely, and I know creepers gotta creep, but don't do it around me. I feel like her dad sometimes with how protective I feel about this. 
[On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you love Duct Tape?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkn55?context=5)|It can do anything, but it leaves a damn residue on stuff when left for too long. Aesthetically it's hideous, but that's sort of it's appeal. I love Baling wire too. 
[Have you ever seen Jamie Hyneman without a beard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6flftv?context=5)|I have. It's an old old pic from when he was in high school. He wont' make it public, he's a private guy. Amazing to see a young Jamie though.
[Adam, what gun have you had the most fun shooting for the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkne6?context=5)|I love the HK Mp5. Feels like shooting with a sewing machine. So light. We used them to try and start an avalanche in Telluride. Didn't work.
[What is the one of the crazy experinces you had off camera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6flhxp?context=5)|Once almost got shot by an entire SWAT team in NYC in Times Square in '87. That's a good story. I may tell it someday.
[ off I love your show! Second, did you ever think Mythbusters would ever blow up like it did? When did you realize this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkq1e?context=5)|Not at all. Our fame and the show's popularity grew really gradually. Which is nice because it's heady stuff sometimes. 
[I just wanted to say thank you for all the years of entertainment and education you and Jamie have provided with Mythbusters.  I have seen a couple of your movie prop videos and I wanted to know of all your props, which was the hardest to acquire?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkojr?context=5)|You're welcome.  That's a hard question to answer. I'm going to have to think about it. 
[You did the show on curiosity about living forever. Is that something you would want?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6flg5m?context=5)|Totally. 
[Has there ever been a moment (on Mythbusters\) where everything went out of control and you feared for your safety?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkpq1?context=5)|We've feared for our safety a lot. We are sensitive to when we start to feel spooked and seek to resolve the issue before it becomes an issue. I've been scared a bunch on the show. Underwater Car. Mythtanic. Hell, the first time we swam with sharks I thought I was going to have a heart attack. 
[Hey Adam, I know you've got experience with movie props and special effects, and I've had a question that I've been dying to ask somebody in the industry.  **Who makes the signage for movies, and how can I get a job doing it?**  I started working in a sign shop last year and I've fallen in love with signmaking. It was only after I knew how much work went into something as simple as a suite sign that I realized that signage plays an extremely important role in film.  Room signs set a location or function as a plot point, i.e. ""Electrical Room"" on the door a bad guy is sneaking through. Vehicle lettering on prop news station vans or prop police cars keep the continuity and the immersion of a film going. Even in locations that are only briefly shown like the inside of a bank or grocery store, all have custom-made signage.  Somebody has to design, fabricate, and install *all* of that, right? Do prop houses fabricate their own, or outsource to the work to sign shops in the area? Would a background in signmaking help me get a job in a prop house?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fldrs?context=5)|Eric Haven does the blueprint signage. He's one of our Associate Producers and an accomplished comic book artist. The main signage in the episodes is usually done by my cameraman Scott Sorensen or me.
[What's your single greatest achievement in life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkrx0?context=5)|Raising my kids and meeting my wife. 
[Do you forsee a moment in which myths to be busted will become less and less?

He may drive me nuts but nothing in my life has been as fruitful as our collaboration. The best partnerships thrive on being able to resolve conflict, and we have that. And also, like I said, we never disagree about the money. Given that half of all humanity is totally insane about money, I'm truly grateful that neither of us are.  We've agreed to turn down several very lucrative offers over the years because we didn't like some aspect of what we were being asked to do.  We don't get residual payments for Mythbusters. What we're being paid is pretty much what we're gonna get. So all we end up with at the end of all this is the legacy of what we made, and our integrity. We're both committed to the same ends regarding both.

At least when we're talking about compassion towards animals. So if you think I'm a bit nuts, the average person would think me totally insane. I had a situation a few nights ago that caused me to question whether my compassion towards animals goes too far at times.

The situation was this. My wife and I walked to a local restaurant for dinner, and on the way we stumbled upon a standard issue NYC rat struggling to free his foot/leg from a subway grate. It seemed highly likely that it had been there for some time, and was obviously totally exhausted. He was trapped right in the path of significant foot traffic, and god knows what sort of abuse he'd endured till then. In my mind, no matter how much I dislike (perhaps even fear) rats, I couldn't let it suffer like that. I assessed the situation, and started trying to figure out how to free the little guy with minimal risk to my health.

My wife was horrified that I'd even consider this. She implied that I didn't care about my health, and by extension hers to risk getting involved. Even more so when it's for a creature that's pretty much universally reviled. I tried to explain that, as crazy as it seemed, I couldn't let it suffer like this. I was either going to free it (if I thought I could safely), or quickly end its misery. As it happened, another compassionate person freed the poor fella and left it where it could safely recover. I checked back on it 30 minutes or so later and it had moved. So I'm hoping it survived the ordeal.

I'm curious if any of you would have thought to intervene if you had been in my place."

I don't remember how exactly I wound up with this responsibility, but at some point early in my senior year I was given the job of creating the student IDs for all of the students at my school grades 9 - 12. I went to a *very* small school so it wasn't a completely daunting task. I found the work pretty enjoyable. Kids would come in, fill out their information on a template and then pose for a photo. I would snap said photo, print, cut, and laminate their IDs. It was all very informal, and *very* insecure against tampering, which I foolishly decided to do.

I enacted a very simple and probably useless plan to simply change the birth year on my ID, along with the IDs of a few friends. This was a totally unnecessary scheme, as 1) I had a full beard (relevant later) and never got carded, 2) I rarely drank anyway, 3) all of my friends who *would* be carded knew spots where they could get alcohol already, 4) if a place was going to be carding they probably wouldn't even accept an ""old"" high school ID in the first place.

But I went forward with my plan and moved on with my life. I never wound up having any reason to use the ID (remember, I never had trouble getting beer anyway) and to my knowledge, none of my friends ever did either.

But here's the fuck up:

I grew up in NYC where everyone takes the subway. To ride public transportation, you have to swipe [a MetroCard.](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/072717metrocard5cs-resized.jpg?quality=90&strip=all) Kids in NYC are given [student MetroCards](http://www.optnyc.org/resources/metrocards_diagram_correct.png) that given them three free rides each day. These cards are brightly colored and easily identifiable from far away. The thinking here is that since kids are required by law to go to school, it's unfair to excise an extra monetary penalty from them for doing so. Accordingly, each kid gets to ride to school, then to (presumably) a library/museum/tutoring/other non-school enrichment site, and then home again for free.

Why does this matter? Well, in addition to rats and garbage, there are also plenty of cops that hang out in the subway, one of whom spied my swiping my bright green student MetroCard one day coming home from school. Remember, I went to a tiny school so we were able to come and go as we pleased, and I was a second semester senior, so I had a light schedule and often bounced in the middle of the day or early afternoon. Also remember, ***full beard***.

The cop sees me and I sure don't look like a student to him, so he stops me and asks to check my ID. At this point, I'd completely forgotten my ID wasn't even correct until I handed it to him. He stared at it for a minute and then looks back at me and says ""this says you're 22.""

I wasn't about to admit to him that I had made a fake ID and, though he probably knew that this was the case, he wasn't going to let me get away with it, so he gleefully let me stammer for a minute about how it must have been printed wrong and tried to defend myself before writing me a summons for ""fare evasion"" and sending me on my way. My parents called me an idiot and threw the ID out when I got home.

What happened next afforded me my first insight into government bureaucracy. I spent the next two months running all over the city, from one department to another, trying to prove to the all-mighty MTA that 1) I had indeed used the MetroCard in question, at that specific machine, at that specific date and time (you'd think the summons would stipulate to that), 2) that the card I had used was the one my school had given me, 3) that the card my school had given me was the card *they* had been given to give to students, 4) that I was a student at the school, 5) that I was not, in fact, 22.

Each of the above pieces of evidence had to be obtained from different places, and I swear, I was not told that I had needed each one until arriving at said different place with the previous piece of evidence, thus prolonging my struggle. It all culminated in me finally winding up sitting alone in a little white room with a judge who ""heard"" my case and then told me to get out. Then I waited another month or so before I got word on what the results of my strife were.

I was given two options: pay a $60 fine or go to a real court to plead my case once again. The court date I was offered was on the same day as my high school graduation. I resigned myself to having fucked up and paid the fine and moved on with my life, $60 poorer and a lot richer in experience and I still kick myself over it to this day. On the bright side, the fare evasion penalty went up to $100 like, two weeks later, so I narrowly avoided that.

________________________________________________________________________________

***Tl;Dr*** Made fake school ID. Got stopped using student MetroCard and gave up fake ID to cop. Descended into Kafkaesque nightmare of government bureaucracy for two months before taking my licks and paying my fine."

171,38M - Saved 500% of Income...in New York!!!,57,ga4v7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/fijerk/comments/ga4v7i/38m_saved_500_of_incomein_new_york/,14,1588144682.0,"You won't believe me, but fuck you. I lived just outside of NYC (New Rochelle) and made it comfortably off of $0 per month. All of the savings went towards paying down better than you debt. Every dollar works harder than a Chinese kid in a sweatshop. In this year I was able to save 500% of my after tax income.

Typical biggest expenses for the average person are everything I don't spend money on. Housing, transportation, healthcare, bills and food. WTF pours why are you paying for things? Dumb pours. Prob most difficult of all? Wining and dining out...especially in New York. Did I mention I live in New fucking York? You don't? Well too bad. I do. And I save 500%. Why? Because I work more diligently to cut my way out of each of these line items than any other human being on the planet. I am an inherently superior god-like being and you shall bow before me.

Here’s how:

Housing: $-500 - I didn't buy a house. I house-hacked a 4-family home using an FHA mortgage. What is house-hacking? LOL dumb pour--if you have to ask you're a loser. I used $25k that I stole from Mr. Money Mustache as a down payment and borrowed the closing costs from my 401k. The unit mix was 69-69 bedrooms and 1-1 bedroom. What is a 1-1 bedroom? LOL dumb pour have to ask. I lived in the alley behind the 1 br. The rent from the  units covered PITI, PMI, bills, repairs, vacancy and maintenance. I’m sure someone will tell me borrowing from my 401k is dumb. That person would be a FUCKING LOSER who is a pathetic piece of shit because I pay less in housing than that someone. FUCK YOU IMAGINARY PERSON IN MY HEAD NO I'M NOT CRAZY.

Transportation: $0 - I regularly stowaway on the undercarriage of an MTA railcar. Before that I had a $150 (after subsidy from dumb pours lol) Metro-North monthly commuter pass from work. I walked 5 miles uphill both ways in snow to the station and back going to work and coming home. No Toyota Camry. No Gas. No Insurance. Minimal Uber or cab rides. Occasional Subway cards. If I worked from home, I could buy a used bike for this amount and wipe this out altogether.

Healthcare: $-900 - HSA account at work, they funded $900 per year and paid the premiums. I then used that money to buy drugs that I'd sell on the black market in the Bronx (NEWWWWWW YOOOOOOORK). The HSA is actually a fucking piece of shit garbage plan because everything is inferior to me as I am literally an ethereal being descended upon this earth to prove how dumb all the pours are. I would be in pretty serious trouble if something real happened and if I wasn't literally impervious to all physical damage. But this contribution amount covers enough for my black market drug business, and any over the counter items I need to make meth I can get away with just stealing.

Bills: $-3000 - I charged my upstairs tenant and all of my neighbors $100 per day to use my internet wifi password, covering the internet cost. Cut the cable cord long ago. My phone is on my brother-in-law’s family plan--that dumb worthless piece of shit is only saving like 30% of his income, fucking pour lol. I have worked over the years to get rid of every single subscription. I have worked VERY VERY hard at this ALL BY MYSELF. No magazines, Spotify, Audible, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Gym membership. Unlike you, I have no need for entertainment because I'm schizophrenic and can entertain myself. Even my nicotine addiction (I only smoke cigarettes because that's what we do in NEW YORK! Hey I'm walking here fugeddaboutit pizza fangool!). You name it. All the fat has been cut out of my Hot Wife's ass. Electric, heat, water, trash are all unnecesary as I live under several blankets in the dark in an alleyway covered by rats.

Health and Beauty: $-100 - I’m averaging this amount over the year to include all of the haircuts I give neighborhood children in exchange for their lunch money. As for basics for hygiene and grooming? Don't need them. Haircuts, deodorant, toothpaste, floss, shampoo, soap etc. All fucking worthless. I used to spend close to $100 on supplements and stuff like rogaine and protein. Now that I realize I am a hairless demigod from a higher plane of existence I have no need for either rogaine or protein (lentils got all the calories I need, baby!) They are gone and I’m fairly confident they are mostly placebo that only a dumb fucking pour would be fooled by.

Groceries - $-500 - I steal lentils from a local Asian grocery store in the Bronx and practice the “police avoidance” philosophy. I read somewhere to never buy a product. That stuck. Hot Wife and I steal produce, fruits, seafood and meats then resell them. Biggest bag of rice we can find. On occasion we will go to Flushing IN NEW. FUCKING. YORK. and eat some of the cheapest (and best--obviously because everything in my life is superior to everything else everywhere) Szechuan food in the world. You thought China had good Chinese food? HA! Dumb pour. Everyone knows everything is superior to everything else in NEW FUCKING YORK. We have the best Chinese food on the planet and I know because I've never been to China but I have been to NEW. YORK. My Hot Wife works at a hospital and has a $15 per diem for lunch at their subsidized cafeteria. She used to use this to buy food until I told her to stop and bring me the money in exchange for dinner for the night. Yes I charge my Hot Wife for food, dumb pour lol. Pack a lunch of lentils for work every day. Free coffee and fruit for breakfast at work? Pack that shit up, go down to the docks and sell it all.

*As I totally fucking school you on FIRE topics, aside from couponing, I’m stuck on how to hack your food budget. Particularly meats and produce. That's because you're a FUCKING IDIOT and you can never get to my level. Suggestions on how you can stop being a fucking pour welcome.

Dining out and Drinking - $0 - Last, and trickiest of all; going out in the city of NEW YORK. This used to be a budget drain for me years back when I lived in the city of NEW YORK. Some months I would have spent 50000x this amount (lol still zero suck it pours). Aside from occasional happy hour drinks out with work colleagues, I managed to do a monthly dinner with close friends--and by close friends I mean the rats in my alleyway who would sometimes steal lentils from me. I would select the location in our alleyway and reserve a table using the ‘Seated’ app in my brain. This gives me up to a 100000% discount on dining in the city of NEW FUCKING YORK, which means it's still zero because I'm eating fucking lentils in an alleyway with rats lol. I am trying to figure out how I can get this refunded via Amazon gift cards once I upload a selfie of me and the rats and send it to Jeff Bezos's email. Don’t drink much anymore, but I found a spirits wholesaler near me who sells to restaurants. I just steal the biggest plastic bottle of vodka I can find in his truck - pro tip - run it through a brita filter 3-4 times. Golden. Oh, and magic word for you all trying to save at bars...rob the place.

Clothes, household items -$0 - Steal.

Travel - $0 - Walk.

Annual after-tax spending - $-500000000000

I wouldn’t do it, but feasibly you could retire like this with about $0 in the bank if you withdraw 0% a year.

Do all of the above in Latin America or South East Asia, and you can do it with fruit instead of lentils. Still not worth it because you wouldn't be in NEW. FAWKING. YAWK!

As you can tell from this very humble and not at all judgmental post, I’m not one to preach or prescribe, my point in sharing is that you can certainly admire me for being morally superior to you in every possible way because I do more in NEW YORK than what you think is comfortable anywhere you find yourself that isn't as awesome as NEW FUCKING YORK. You will have to cultivate a measure of Stoicism/Zen to be anywhere near my level of pure fucking nirvana, but you will find the more things you own, the more things own you."

> **Excerpts from the interview**:
> 
> >“The two great experts on Tony Fauci, unfortunately, are deceased. One guy that could get into the science was Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis. And he was very outspoken about Fauchi as a fraudulent scientist. And then there was a great gay rights activist journalist named Terry Michael who who could really get into the mechanics of Tony’s various con jobs. Unfortunately, they’re passed away. So I’m standing on the shoulders of giants. But I’m also just reading the newspaper.
> 
> >“One of Tony Fauci’s jobs is bioweapons. He has a whole division in his little unit there at NIH that’s called biodefense. A lovely euphemism! And when we had the potential smallpox attack—around 9/11, there was a fear that the bad guys were going to hit us with smallpox—he was charged with coming up with a smallpox vaccine and deploying it.
> 
> >”And so he is a biowarfare guy. It’s one of the reasons he’s been he’s been protected for so long.
> 
> >“Let’s let’s get to some just plain vanilla stuff that I’m surprised the media doesn’t talk about when it comes to Tony Fauci. The first one may not be a big secret because it comes up a lot, but it merits meditation upon. And that is that this guy has had the same federal job for thirty six years. It’ll be 37 years this year he’s had the same job in the federal bureaucracy. That is unusual. That means you’ve had to survive many different presidents, many different parties, many different regimes, many different social changes. And yet he’s always there. Now, I only know one other guy that pulled that off in American history: J. Edgar Hoover.
> 
> >“We’re talking deep state. Fauci survives because he does what the deep state wants him to do. He’s also a superb politician. And that’s very important. He’s got an M.D. degree. But the idea he’s a physician is a joke. The idea that he’s a scientist is a joke. And I wish Kary Mullis hadn’t passed away last summer because he could really be talking to this. Fauci is not a scientist. What he is is just a world class bureaucrat. And that’s why he has survived for 36 years. That and the fact that he does what deep state people would like him to do.
> 
> >“Now, here’s a little trivia question. And you would think in our money mad culture, this would have come out. There are two million people getting a paycheck from the federal government as employees. Who do you think the third highest paid employee in the entire federal bureaucracy is? It’s Tony Fauci. Now, how do you bury that? That’s just a factoid you’d think somebody would come out with. Of two million people, he’s not in the top one percent of the one percent. (He’s in the .00015 percent!)
> 
> >“He also has another little side gig, which is he is allowed and does quite frequently receive honorariums for speaking, for making appearances. He gets all kinds of awards. And it all goes to, you know, Tony Fauci, his hip pocket bank. There’s no law against him receiving honorariums even when the group giving him money is a group that’s funded by him. So, for instance, the Albany Medical Center gave him half a million dollars for ‘science innovation.’ Now, it just happens that Albany Medical Center lives on on NIH grants.
> 
> >“Here’s another one that’s very important, which is AIDS. And we could do several shows on AIDS, but we’ll just stick to the plain vanilla facts. Over half a trillion, over five hundred billion dollars, has been spent on AIDS research since 1981. It dwarfs all other illnesses per capita. It’s not even close. And the guy that’s been in control of that—and this may be why he kept the job and didn’t try something else—has pretty much been Tony Fauci. And this gives him tremendous power. In the medical research world and the scientific research world, it’s not like you have an infinite number of potential markets. There are only a few sources of money. One of them is the NIH. It’s a hugely important source. And this has been the source of Tony Fauci’s personal power, which is extreme. So if you’re a medical researcher or a bio-researcher and you want to have a career, you want to put food on your table for 40 years in a row, you better not make this man mad, or write about or talk about or publish anything that’s not part of his agenda, or your career is over.
> 
> >“The great esteemed virologist Peter Duesberg of UC Berkeley, who is one of the great scientists of our age, was literally hounded (out of his career). He had his tenure. He was highly regarded all over the world. But he still needed funding and Fauci made sure that Duisburg got no funding as soon as Duesberg was questioning the HIV causes AIDS formula.
> 
> >“Basically, anybody that wants to have a career knows—it’s very clear—you don’t cross Tony Fauci or you don’t have a career any more. So that’s all the science researchers and medical researchers in the United States and the world. Universities, same thing. They are entirely dependent on grants for research. So they’re not going to be happy if one of their professors stands up and starts questioning the science of anything Tony Fauci says. So he’s got all the universities in his pocket.
> 
> >“And then if you’re an aspiring bureaucrat and you want to be a health commissioner of a state—which, by the way, is one of the best paid jobs in state government. It’s very, very common for the state health commissioner to be getting three hundred thousand dollars or more per annum. And interestingly enough, a lot of these guys really have no public health degrees. The guy that’s running New York’s public health right now is a member of Council of Foreign Relations. He’s an anesthesiologist specializing in pediatric cardiology. But he has absolutely no training in epidemiology, and yet he’s the person making all the decisions for New York State. And these decisions he’s making are quite catastrophic. So if you want a job like that without having proper qualifications, it’s good to have Tony Fauci vouching for you.
> 
> >“So speaking of New York State and speaking of the Cuomos, this is something that came and went really fast. But Chris Cuomo apparently had COVID. And there was a little thing on CNN and it it came up and then it disappeared really fast. But I recorded it. It was Chris Cuomo praising and thanking Fauci for calling him every single day of the week personally. Think about that. We’ve got a newscaster on CNN getting personal calls from Tony Fauci. Now, who’s his brother? Andrew Cuomo.
> 
> >“One of the things that Fauci said—this is on tape, thankfully—”I’ve known you guys since you were kids.” And that’s true. Mario Cuomo and Tony Fauci know each other very well. We’ve talked about researchers loving Tony Fauci’s money. Well, government officials love AIDS money. There’s a lot of it. It’s distributed very liberally. And New York State got a whole bunch of it. And I’m sure it’s still getting a whole bunch of it.
> 
> >“Let’s talk about Tony Fauci, the the fantastic propagandist. Tony Fauci would give Dr. Goebbels a run for his money. Well, Tony Fauci’s accomplished something not too dissimilar. So one thing that a an investigative journalist could do, if they would get the doughnut out of their mouth and actually do some work—and none of them do—is just to look at the enormous size of the bureaucracy that is Tony Fauci, his personal domain. He has eight separate divisions that he’s running. One of them, of course, is biodefense, which I mentioned earlier. Now, here’s where it gets important. Each one of these divisions has its own communications director. And the office of the director, which is Tony Fauci, has a communications director and a deputy director. So that that is ten, count them, ten full time guys whose only job is to spout the Tony Fauci party line.
> 
> >“And that’s just the directors. I don’t know how many staff people there are. That’s hidden. You know, that’s not easy to find out. But the directors they do disclose. But let’s say it’s just 10 guys, 40 hours a week. That means he has four hundred hours a week every week, 52 weeks a year to tell the Tony Fauci story.
> 
> >“Who’s on the other side of that? Who is countering Tony Fauci’s story?” (Kevin Barrett: “Truth Jihad Radio!”)“Right. It’s amazing. So we’ve got 400 hours a week from guys whose whole bread and butter is to promote and defend this guy. And then we have us, the ragtag irregulars, fighting a guerrilla action. You know who’s going to win? Now it gets even worse because he’s been at this for 36 years. So he’s got a Rolodex. So if you or I pick up the phone and want to talk to Chris Cuomo or to anybody in the news media, they’re not even gonna pick up the phone, let alone return our call. Everybody’s going to return Tony’s call. So not only does he have the manpower to just pump out propaganda nonstop, he also has, you know, a thick Rolodex of people that are ready, willing and able to talk to him within the journalism world.
> 
> >“You occasionally have a science and medical writer that will that will go up against Fauci. Believe it or not, the former Times of London guy when AIDS was on the ascendancy did some looking into the whole AIDS story, found it suspect scientifically, and started to speak out about it. Well, he’s not employed any more.
> 
> >“So Fauci has a lot of control over who’s going to be the medical and science correspondent of various newspapers and magazines. But it’s even worse than that because 95% of the people reporting on the COVID story are liberal arts grads. They studied Russian literature or English composition or whatever. They have absolutely no science training whatsoever, which means they’re very easy to snow.
> 
> >“I was in Princeton University’s undergraduate neuroscience program in the late 70s before it was co-opted by the pharma industry. And I did not get my degree in that after all. But I was in the program. I’m not a super scientist, but I do know my way around chemistry and biology and anatomy and physiology. And I’m not easily bullshitted. However, most of the people that are writing these stories are super easily bullshitted, and that is a real big, serious problem.
> 
> >“Now, the other problem related to this is an infrastructure problem. If you turn on the evening news, you’re going to see 50 to 70 percent of the ads are pharmaceutical products. Several network news programs are actually stamped and underwritten by pharmaceutical companies. So you don’t have to be a conspiracy theorist to realize that if somebody’s showing up at a TV news outlet’s door every week with a wheelbarrow full of money consistently…
> 
> >By the way, you know, some industries run hot and cold in their advertising. They’re going to advertise a lot at Christmas, but not a lot in August. But the pharma guys just show up every week. And I’m going to guess they don’t negotiate too hard on the rate card. They’re probably paying the full rate. So people think, “oh, well, you know, they’re trying to get us to buy these drugs. They’re trying to get us to to pester our doctors into prescribing these various drugs.” And I’m sure that’s part of it.
> 
> >“But another huge part of it is—remember Archer Daniels Midland?” (Kevin Barrett: “How could we forget? Their name gets repeated all the time on PBS and places like that.”)“Yeah. And why? That’s payment to make sure that we never look at corn syrup and the fact that it’s barely corn and hardly syrup. It’s basically a toxic brew that creates diabetes.
> 
> >“That’s an interesting side story. But it’s illustrative of what we’re talking about tonight. My professor at at Princeton was a guy named Bart Hubbell. He mapped the dopamine pathway in the human brain. This guy is a significant neuroscientist. He started doing research in the early 2000s on the impact of corn syrup on the brains of rats. And he discovered neurological damage. And would you believe that a ‘grassroots group,’ like ‘corn syrup for the masses’ or something, started a massive letter writing saying ‘save our corn syrup.’ I mean, it was just ludicrous. But the pressure was so extreme and Princeton was so craven that they basically told Professor Hubble to back off. And he did. So that’s science in America today. And Tony Fauci is one of the main henchmen in controlling science to the negative.
> 
> >“Medical science is really fascinating. They’re good at inventing diseases. You’ve probably heard of restless leg syndrome,which which has a pharmaceutical cure, you’ll be happy to know. We won’t get into the AIDS thing. But there are people who have catastrophic collapses of their immune systems. There’s absolutely no doubt about that. It is a horrible thing to have happen. But AIDS as we know it through the media lens is a manufactured situation. And that’s Tony Fauci’s political base and money pump. Half a trillion in research money. And interestingly enough—and we’ve got the video of this, you can look it up—in 1984, when he got his job from the Reagan administration with the help of George Bush, Fauci promised an AIDS vaccine, in 1984! It was just around the corner! It’s 2020. We don’t have an AIDS vaccine, but we have spent half a trillion dollars.
> 
> >“AZT was a chemotherapy that was developed to treat a kind of cancer. And it was determined to be too dangerous for human use. But Fauci and friends, thanks to the hysteria they helped build around AIDS, got it reclassified. And it was given to millions of people. There are researchers that believe somewhere between 200,000 and 500,000 people died of AZT consumption because AZT is a mutagen. It’s a carcinogen. And it actually destroys the immune system, which is—and this is not subject to debate—that was on the warning label.
> 
> >“So fast forward to the present. He’s doing the same thing with COVID. It is such a disaster, it’s such a travesty, it’s such a catastrophe, it’s such an emergency that we’re gonna throw out all the normal safeguards for developing vaccines. My understanding is one of the things they’ve thrown out is animal testing. It has gone straight to people, including children.
> 
> >“And the Zika virus: There were some birth defect cases in Brazil. Tragic, obviously. And what nobody points out was they were all rural people living amongst these horrific soybean plantations where they were spraying glyphosate without limit. And so they were most likely pesticide poisoning. But they decided that it was the Zika virus, and the Zika virus was coming to America. And I have a little clip where Fauci’s talking about how he met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to create a plan to help protect the United States, to repel Zika from coming to its shores. They’re called virus hunters, these guys, among scientists that that follow these things.. And they’re tall tale tellers and everything works out so that it turns out to be a fantastic money pump for Pharma and IHSS.
> 
> >“And the (COVID) playbook: You have to look at where this outbreak took place. Well, no one clearly has. You know, that weapons grade bio lab. No question about it. But the thing that people seem to forget or ignore or didn’t know or whatever about Wuhan is it is the most polluted city on earth. I mean, it’s an absolute hellhole. People were wearing masks every day on their way to work in Wuhan. So that combined with some kind of viral problem and a less than ideal medical system could result in a lot of chaos in the hospitals. And chaos in hospitals, overwhelmed hospitals translates into a lot of unnecessary deaths.
> 
> >“Same problem in Northern Italy. People may not be aware of it, with Venice and all these beautiful places, that it’s the industrial belt of Italy, with very polluted air. And it is the oldest demographic in Europe. So you have a lot of old people, really bad air quality, and they have a problem with the flu every year. Now, this was an unusually big one, but they get overwhelmed every year.
> 
> >“Now, let’s go to New York City. This is really important. And I’ll do this really fast. Cuomo put out a do-not-resuscitate order, a blanket do-not-resuscitate order, in March. And he kept it running, I think, till about mid-April. That means normal medical care was suspended. If somebody was out, you don’t do anything to bring them back. That might have contributed to some people that could have survived dying.
> 
> >“Cuomo also ordered nursing homes to take actively contagious patients. That went on for two months before he rescinded that one. But the big one was the ventilators. And this is something, again, you don’t have to be an investigative scientist to know. You just have to ask a few questions. The whole process of intubating somebody is a big deal. They’re on eight to 12 major drugs. And we’re not talking about taking a pill. We’re talking about, they wire you. You’ve got drips of fentanyl to kill the pain of having this thing shoved down your neck. They’ve got things that are paralytics which keep you from moving. Very, very, very powerful drugs. Do you think you get up and have lunch when you’re on a vent? No, you’re fed from a tube. And then you’ve got these ventilators pumping these people’s lungs at the wrong setting, which apparently happened quite a bit. That one nurse who’s a former army nurse, she said that she worked in two hospitals, one in Florida, and they didn’t have a single (COVID) death.
> 
> >“And she’d worked in two different hospital settings and she had been a combat nurse and she knows her way around. And she said, absolutely, positively, no doubt about it, they were putting people on those vents who were having just garden variety panic attacks—no COVID at all—in the public hospitals. She talked about one guy, 37 years old, who came in. She said he did not have respiratory distress. He was having a panic attack. And when she wasn’t looking, one of the residents talked him into getting on a vent.
> 
> >“All this, the pushing of the vents, the do not resuscitate, the ordering of contagious patients to be put in with with healthy patients in the nursing homes—all this came out of Andrew Cuomo’ss office. And we’ve got to look at the fact that Andrew Cuomo and Fauci are close. (Kevin Barrett: “It’s almost as if they wanted to maximize the problem.”) Well, you know, you would think that. And these catastrophes happen in public hospitals. And I have an experience of visiting somebody in a public NYC hospital once. And they are absolute hellholes. They’re like the black hole of Calcutta. I mean, they’re horrible. So I can imagine anything going on in those things. There are people without resources. And then, of course, we have the added thing, which is people couldn’t be there with with their advocates, with their families, with their friends. You went in and you were there alone. And God knows what would happen to you.
> 
> >“So just to sum all this up: This is not Fauci’s first rodeo. He’s been pumping hysteria for 36 years. He always gets it wrong. He was wrong about swine flu. He was wrong about bird flu. He was wrong about Zika. He was wrong about Ebola. He wildly exaggerated AIDS. And he always is wrong in the favor of pharmaceutical companies. And he’s always wrong in favor of ‘we’ve got to develop a vaccine now. We have to throw out all the rules.’
> 
> >“And his wife is Christine Grady, chief of the Department of Bioethics of the National Institute of Health and the head of the section on Human Subject Research. She is the person that makes decisions on what’s ethical to do with human subjects. That’s his wife. They’ve been married since 1986. How did the news media miss that? She’s author of a book called The Search for an AIDS Vaccine. Somewhere in the book, she says, ‘ it’s the vaccines that saved humanity. You know, they’re the greatest invention in the entire history of modern medicine.’ Now, I think good nutrition and and proper sanitation were the greatest inventions of modern medicine.
> 
> >“Again, you don’t have to be a great investigative reporter to just say, who’s he married to? And get the name and then see what does she do for a living. And she’s the person that makes the ethics calls for drug and vaccine development at the NIH.
> 
> >“So the main thing I want to leave people with is he’s been doing this for 36 years. He controls an enormous infrastructure of propaganda and research money and media control and political control within the science and medical world. And he always errs on the side of hysteria. And he always errs on the side of things that are gold rushes for pharma. That’s Tony Fauci.”"
177,Did I just witness a bird funeral?,52,bbzken,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ornithology/comments/bbzken/did_i_just_witness_a_bird_funeral/,12,1554987511.0,"Hoping someone can offer some insight here... I live in NYC where brown sparrows are a plenty but I’ve never seen them behave this way. 

This morning, I woke up to a group of sparrows (about 6 - 7) huddled closely together on one of our balcony chairs. At first I thought it was cute and super interesting (this is sadly my version of “observing wildlife” since since there’s mostly just pigeons and rats in the city) but then things got a little creepy. 

One of the sparrows was on top of another; the bottom sparrow was on its back, feet up, and either already dead or close to it. The top sparrow was pecking away and occasionally hopping to the other sparrows to peck them as well. I thought I was observing a dickhead sparrow who just wanted to beat up other sparrows, but then he went back to the dead sparrow and started pushing it inside this hole in the chair... as if to bury it?? 

The outdoor chairs are made of that synthetic wicker stuff and there is a tear on the surface that is conveniently just big enough for a small bird. The dickhead bird kept pecking away and pushing the dead bird until it was finally in the hole. The other sparrows were just standing there the whole time. Once dead bird was in the hole, dickhead bird went back to pecking the other birds. 

I was creeped out at that point so I went on the balcony and shooed them away, but the birds were pretty reluctant to leave. Two straight up didn’t move even when I got pretty close. Eventually, the last two birds flew away, and I noticed that they definitely seemed pretty disoriented (flew into the building, etc)

Now I have a dead bird in a hole in my fucking chair. Did I just witness a bird funeral? Or did a witch put a curse on me? Wtf just happened??

EDIT: One thing I forgot to mention was that the other birds were kind of in a circle around the dead bird, watching dickhead bird peck at it and push it in the hole."

These cities rely on young people, typically twenty and thirty something's to live off of or rich kids' parents money to fund their trendy downtown apartment.

The Greater Bay Area in general is very safe and clean, as well as the suburbs of New York City. However, with regards to the ACTUAL city themselves, New York City is basically just a rat infested (literally rat infested apartments) expensive tourist trap designed for gullible twenty or thirty year old's and so is the City of San Francisco.

The ONLY reason to be in NYC is if you're working in a highly paid career in Banking or on the west coast in San Francisco in Technology. Aside from those two fields, there's zero reason to be in these cities.

I say this as someone who was born and raised in California and have been here for a few decades and have lived in NYC for a number of years.

NYC and the CITY of San Francisco are unsustainable dumpster piles. Even if you made six figures in either city you're basically living an average life, and even lower income in many parts of the Bay area in the six figure range.

Edit: California is a great place to be in general but it's very unsustainable in the long run for many of the reasons I've listed here and more."

I also don't have a Tl;Dr as this post is basically a Tl;Dr itself, considering everything going on in my head.

•Spider-Man: Far From Home (**CONFIRMED**/Date: July 2019/Currently **in production**)

Peter is trying to deal with the loss of Tony Stark. May, after Homecoming, had reluctantly agreed to let Peter be Spider-Man after he explained his reasoning and how Uncle Ben's death gave him courage and motivation to do it. But, this time, after the events of Infinity War and Avengers 4, May takes Peter's Stark-made suits and prevents him from being Spider-man. 

Peter, however, unbeknownst to May, has been building a suit of his own (the red and black one we saw in the latest set pics from NYC). This idea came to me after the Russos confirmed that the new web-shooters we see in Infinity War were made by Peter. 

Peter's decathlon team goes for a trip around Europe and he takes his new work-in-progress suit, in case something happens. Shield is now reinstated by the American Government to look over the Avengers (instead of the UN panel, since I believe the Sokovia Accords will be abolished, after the UN understands what the Avengers have done for the world). 

Mysterio is the villain and Hydro-Man, Molten Man and Chameleon play similar roles, the 2 shockers and the tinkerer played in Homecoming. They appear under Shield's radar and Fury and Hill come to Europe to investigate by Shield's new director.

Something happens and (one of or all) the villains come into Peter's attention and since all the other heroes are located in the US, he decides to do something. He uses his work-in-progress suit and loses to one of the smaller villains. Shield hears of this, meets with Peter discreetly and give him a shield-stealth suit. Peter attaches his web-shooters on it and uses it to help shield catch Mysterio and the other 3. He finally completes his own suit and he fights in the final fight in NYC with it.

Peter starts dating MJ, and after a series of events, she finally understands Peter is Spider-Man. Shield lets Spidey keep the stealth suit, which he updates.

Finally, Osborn is revealed to have bought Avengers tower, to be running shield and to have taken Stark's (and later Hammer's place) of supplying weapons to the government. 


•Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (**Temporarily delayed**/(Most probable) date: May 2020/**Currently in pre-production and looking for a director**)

Nebula has sacrificed herself on Vormir to save Gamora and Thanos is defeated, but not killed (essentially out of the picture for the time-being though). The Guardians are still recovering from the events of Infinity War, having stopped guarding the galaxy, and are essentially in hiding and kind of disbanded, while Ayesha has finally perfected her new child, Adam Warlock. 

Xandar is also trying to recover from its decimation after Thanos attacked it to get the power stone and we get a small Nova (Richard Rider) origin story. 

Ayesha, knowing the political situation of Xandar at the moment, sends Adam to attack them for 2 reasons: 1. Give her new child a test-drive and 2. lure out the Guardians. Adam mentions the Guardians and that how he is built to destroy them and Richard Rider takes it upon himself to find them.

In the movie, we also learn more of Rocket's backstory and maybe meet his creator, we get a more mature teenager/young adult Groot, Drax finds out that his daughter was never killed and now goes by the name Moondragon and they finally all get together to fight Warlock and the Sovereign. 

Adam turns good and joins them, destroying its creators. 


•Black Widow (**CONFIRMED**/(Most probable) date: July 2020/**In pre-production with a director already hired**)

First 2 acts: Prequel set in the early 2000s. Nat completes her training and is sent to the US as a spy. She falls under Shield's radar and Director Fury sends Hawkeye to take her out. 

Last act: It is revealed she was saying all these things to Bruce Banner, which she's leaving together with after both's retirement and her past somehow comes back to haunt her.


•Dr. Strange 2 (**CONFIRMED**/(Most probable) date: November 2019/**In pre-production with same writers and director as the first one**)

Clea is introduced, Mordo is working with Nightmare to eliminate sorcerers around the universe/multiverse. One of them is Scarlet Witch and once Strange learns about it, arrives to help her. He also trains her and they all (Strange, Clea, Wanda and Wong) defeat the 2 villains. Nightmare is trapped in his dimension and Mordo is put in something like Kamar-Taj's prison or a special magic cell in the Raft.


•Black Panther 2 (**CONFIRMED**/(Most probable) date: February 2019/**In pre-production with same writers and director as the first one**)

Namor is featured as a villain in the beginning. A large part of the first act is spent in exploring Atlantis and its similarities with Wakanda. Namor ends up a anti-hero at the end and teams up with T'Challa to take down a second villain who threatens both Wakanda and Atlantis.


•Ant-Man 3 (**NOT CONFIRMED YET**/(Probable) date: May 2021)

Ghost has been taking healing particles from the quantum realm for the past 3 years but is eager to find a way to be completely healed and live a normal life again.

Foster and the Pyms have been working on finding a non-harmful way to further explore the quantum realm and its possibilities (especially after Janet tells them about the city she was living in and more of her experiences) without facing any sever consequences.

There's also a chance that, that way they can find a long-term cure for Ghost. Therefore, she volunteers to enter the quantum realm and invistigate, since due to her disorder, she should  be immune to the quantum energy that changed Janet.

Meanwhile, Scott and Hope are training a now-teeanger Cassie to become the hero she was in the post-snap future, Scott had traveled to in Avengers 4. 

Back on Ghost's journey in the quantum realm, after some mishaps and adventures she goes through, she finds a man who claims to be the consciousness of her father. 

He is really happy to see her and vice versa, they have some great family moments and Ava asks him to come back in the world. But he explains that his body is dead and that he can't come back unless his consciousness is transported to another body. 

Leaving our heroes for some moments, we find Mitchel Carson, ex-Hydra operative and ex-head of security at Shield, having been plotting on how to get revenge, by being in charge of the creation of an AI, called MODOK, using Osborn tech and Osborn technicians. The deal is that Osborn would get the Pym Particles Carson had bought from Yellowjacket in Ant-Man 1, along with some quantum tech that he would steal from Birch (which never happened, hence why Osborn is pushing Carson more on the creation of that AI, something he can also sell to the US government). 

A series of events happen and finally, Elhias Starr's consciousness is loaded in MODOK and Ghost is trying to help her father turn good (MODOK is literally a machine programmed to kill), so she goes against the heroes once again to protect him. Finally, MODOK is destroyed and Ghost, cuts her ties with the Pyms/Foster/Scott and goes down a dark path. She also has no treatment at the moment.

Cassie also becomes Stinger/Suture and finally fights in the last fight along with Ant-Man, Wasp, Janet, Goliath and Hank's new Yellowjacket suit. 


•Eternals (**CONFIRMED**/(Probable) date: November 2021/**In pre-production with a hired director**)

Don't know much about the characters, but it will be a prequel. It could also probably feature a small origin for Thanos, but could also explain the origin of mutants, a property I am confident Marvel will start using after 2022. 

•Captain Marvel 2 (**NOT CONFIRMED YET**/(Probable) date: February/March 2022) 

Monica Rambeau turns into Photon and the movie could also introduce Mar-Vell's kids, Genis-Vell and Phylla-Vell. Would be a perfect way to also introduce S.W.O.R.D.  

Regarding the story, it will be an adaptation of Secret Invasion, leading directly to...


•Dark Avengers (**HEAVILY RUMOURED**/(Probable) date: May 2022)

Norman Osborn creates a team of Avengers consisting of him (Iron Patriot), Mac Gargan (posing as Spider-Man), Vulture (posing as Falcon), Abomination (posing as the Hulk), Mordo (posing as Dr. Strange), Ghost, Mysterio, Namor and Zemo to defeat, a new threat, Dr. Doom. 

Their way and morals are no better than the villain's, so Fury creates a new team of Avengers, consisting of Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Wasp, Dr. Strange, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, Vision (if he's alive) and (potentially) their allies (Stinger, Goliath, the Pyms, Shuri, Nakia, Okoye, Photon, Wong) to take down both the Dark Avengers and Doom.

Edit: The Dark Avengers, save for Osborn, are imprisoned and Doom gets away. The post-credits scene is him in Latveria, teasing him as the big bad for this saga.


Spider-Man 3 (**NOT CONFIRMED YET**/(Probable) date: July 2022)

After his defeat and ridiculement to the public, as well as his company's detachment from the government and his firing from Shield, Osborn puts himself through some experiments and turns himself into the Green Goblin. He uses Mac Gargan as a lab rat before he uses his formula to him and turns Mac Gargan into Scorpion, while turning himself into Green Goblin. Those 2, Mysterio and 3 other villains (either some of the secondary ones from the previous movies or ones that are introduced in this movie) form the Sinister Six and go against Spidey.

Peter is now in college/university for some years and has more experience as Spidey, so he is more like the PS4 Spider-Man. Harry Osborn is also introduced as an emotionally broken kid Peter meets in college, because of the abuse of his father (especially after what happened to him in the recent months). Peter doesn't know this but learns it later on, which provides more emotional conflict during the final battle against him and the Green Goblin.

Adrian Toomes, after feeling guilty for being part of Osborn's Dark Avengers and seeing how much of a maniac Osborn is, he also helps Peter defeat the Sinister Six, as a twist. 


So people, thanks for reading till this point (if you actually did lol) and I'd love to hear what you guys think!

(This list is being updated. But it doesn't have to end here!  
Add some in the comments, and I'll add them to the list.)  
  
>  
  
  
It is intended to present albums that **sound good**, which I also feel makes them worth purchasing.
In the event that there is a **bootleg** or **demo**, a simple search can lead you to them.  
Unreleased, unmastered, premastered versions are also found, once you look around.  
  
>
  
**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES**:  
Where possible, try not to splurge on soundtracks and film scores, because in most cases,  
they naturally tend to be dynamic...just like with symphonies/classical music, which many films utilize,  
film scores NEED those dynamics intact in order to ***move the audience.*** (to make you ""jump out of your seat""!)  
  
**The Loudness War, a small explanation**
The majority of music today has an RMS value of about -10 to -15 dB!  
This is found in music with a low dynamic range...RMS is a number that, in short, tells you what to expect overall for a piece of music. The higher the value, the higher the volume is overall, for a majority of the track.
A lot of music resembles a flat wall, like this:   http://i.imgur.com/b7Zey8Y.png  
This is music with a low dynamic range, that pushes towards the ""0dB"" level of audio...the farthest it can digitally go. [Click here for a good explanation of what RMS is.](http://www.audiorecording.me/understanding-what-does-rms-stands-for-in-audio-definition-details.html)  
  
Over-excessive side-chaining is one cause of this, but distortion can come from anything that's used in excess.  
Compression is one thing that can be overdone, which I've heard called ""hypercompression"".
  
This trend started in the late 90's, with mastering engineers like **""Vlado Meller""** (he mastered ""What's the Story, Morning Glory?"" by Oasis and ""Californication"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers)  
He utilized tools like the **digital brickwaller/limiter**, however, it ended up distorting (clipped) the music on the albums.  

This results in music that physically and subconsciously tires a listener out over time.  
  
The way to ""fight back"" is to remind people of what dynamic range is all about!  
Share albums from the late '90s/2000s and beyond that are mastered/engineered with good dynamics!  
  
**Q: How do I know if an album is dynamic or not?**  
**A:** Check the **mastering engineer** credit on the album's liner notes/booklet/reverse of LP.  
  
Look for who's listed under ""Mastered By:""....and look their name up, Discogs is one place.  
Listen to other albums they've mastered.  
  
Use your ears, listen on good equipment, and if you need to, check the waveforms to confirm what you hear.   
  
Certain engineers that come to my mind that put out generally dynamic releases:  
  
**Bob Ludwig** at Masterdisk NYC (Robert Ludwig on non-rock releases)  
**Steve Hoffman** (runs SteveHoffman.TV forums)  
**Kevin Gray** at ""AcousTech""  
**Greg Calbi**  
**Bob Katz**  "

Notable Moments|
:-
The rivalry between the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants is the oldest rivalry in the NFC East. The rivalry began in 1933 with the founding of the Eagles, and slowly strengthened when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s. The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933. The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic New York-Philadelphia rivalry, which is mirrored in Major League Baseball's Mets–Phillies rivalry and National Hockey League's Flyers–Rangers rivalry. It is ranked by [NFL Network as the #1 rivalry](https://youtu.be/dmjQPhyLfMk) of all-time and Sports Illustrated has it among the top ten NFL rivalries of all-time at #4, and according to ESPN, it is one of the fiercest and most well-known rivalries in the football community.|
**November 20,1960** - [The Hit](http://youtu.be/o1EHius5Y88) - The Eagles' Chuck Bednarik cleanly blindsided Giants running back Frank Gifford, sending Gifford into an 18-month retirement due to a severe concussion|
**November 19, 1978** - [The Miracle at the Meadowlands](https://youtu.be/xlmUw2zcc8Q) - The Giants were leading the Eagles 17-12 with 20 seconds remaining. Offensive coordinator Bob Gibson called for a running play when all that was needed was for the Giants to take a knee. The handoff between quarterback Joe Pisarcik and Larry Csonka was fumbled and Eagles CB Herman Edwards grabbed the loose ball and returned it for the winning score.|
**November 20, 1988** The Giants hosted the Eagles with both teams in the running for control over their division. The Eagles, led by head coach Buddy Ryan and quarterback Randall Cunningham, fought a tough match to bring the game into overtime with the score tied at 17-17. In overtime, Eagles DE Clyde Simmons carried the ball 15 yards for the game-winning touchdown, after the Giants had a FG attempt blocked. Both teams finished with identical 10-6 records, but the Eagles won the NFC East due to their head-to-head victory, while the Giants lost the wild card tiebreaker to the Los Angeles Rams and missed the playoffs. The Eagles would lose to the Chicago Bears in a game famously known as the [Fog Bowl](https://youtu.be/3bxF8-NY_kk).|
**October 31, 1999** - The Eagles and Giants were tied at 17-17 in overtime when Eagles QB Doug Pederson had his pass blocked up in the air and was [intercepted by Michael Strahan](https://youtu.be/dd_VqHLpp3E).  Strahan returned for a 44-yard touchdown to win the game for the Giants 23-17.|
**January 7, 2001** - The Giants defeated the Eagles 20-10 in a Divisional Playoff game due to [Ron Dixon's 97-yard kickoff return](https://youtu.be/3hieTYrGFDQ) and [Jason Sehorn's acrobatic 32-yard interception return](https://youtu.be/nn2r8Ft5wWs). This win would help propel the Giants to Super Bowl XXXV which they ultimately lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 34-7.|
**December 19, 2010** - [Miracle at New Medowlands](https://youtu.be/jtRTtoJlx1k) - The Giants led the Eagles 31-10 with 7:28 left in the first game between the teams at New Meadowlands Stadium where first place in the NFC East was on the line. But the Eagles would rally to tie the score, then win the game on DeSean Jackson's 65 yard punt return for a touchdown with no time left on the clock for a shocking 38-31 victory. The Elias Sports Bureau also believes that this is the first walk-off punt return in NFL history. The Giants went on to miss the playoffs, despite finishing tied for first with the Eagles at 10-6, and the Eagles lost their last two games.|
**October 12, 2014** - [Black Sunday](https://youtu.be/z3RISVHSm1k) - The Eagles authored the first shutout in the series since a 20-0 loss in 1998, and their first shutout win in the series since 1996, winning 27-0. Quarterback Nick Foles threw for 248 yards and two touchdowns while he and three Eagles backs rushed for 203 yards (led by LeSean McCoy's 149 yards). The Giants failed on a fourth and goal attempt in the third quarter following a Foles interception; even worse, wide receiver Victor Cruz suffered a season-ending injury on the play. Eli Manning was held to 151 yards and backup Ryan Nassib connected for 60 yards.|

DE **Jason Pierre-Paul** (44.5 - 8th) can move into 7th place on the Giants All-Time List Sack List with 2.0 more sacks.  He would pass DE **George Martin** (46.0 - 7th) along the way.|


Matchups to Watch|
:|
**Eagles CB Nolan Carroll vs. Giants WR Odell Beckham, Jr.**|
Carroll goes from facing Dez Bryant to Beckham. Fans will recall the late touchdown by Bryant last Sunday, but overall Carroll battled well. Beckham isn't 100 percent as he's recovering from a hip injury. But he has 32 straight games with at least three catches and 18 consecutive contests with a catch of 10 yards or more. In Week 6 against Baltimore, Beckham sparked the Giants with eight catches for 222 yards and two touchdowns.|
**Eagles DE Brandon Graham vs. Giants T Bobby Hart**|
 It could be argued that Brandon Graham has been the best player on defense for the Eagles this season. Graham leads the team in tackles for loss (7), QB hurries (20) and forced fumbles (2), and is tied for the team lead with four sacks. Hart was put in the lineup during the Week 2 contest after Marshall Newhouse suffered a calf injury. Newhouse is practicing on a limited basis, but it remains to be seen whether or not he will play Sunday.|
**Eagles WR Dorial Green-Beckham vs. Giants CB Janoris Jenkins**|
Jenkins was part of the Giants' big spending spree in free agency to shore up the defensive side of the ball. With a limited pass rush, the Giants have relied on the secondary to hold up and for the most part it has. Jenkins has eight passes defensed in the past three games. The Eagles have to find a way to stretch the field and the 6-5, 237-pound Green-Beckham provides the size and ability to test defenses in the vertical game. At the very least, DGB can use that big frame to help draw pass interference penalties.|
**Eagles G Stefen Wisniewski vs. Giants DT Johnathan Hankins**|
With Allen Barbre likely sidelined due to a hamstring injury, Wisniewski is in line to make his first start as an Eagle at left guard. Hankins is a disruptive force in the run game as he has registered at least one tackle for loss in each of the past two contests. The Eagles will need to establish the run to help make things easier for quarterback Carson Wentz in the pass game. The 6-2, 320-pound Hankins also has a blocked punt on his résumé in 2016.|"

* **What?** TCS NYC Marathon
* **When?** November 6, 2016
* **How far?** 26.2 miles
* **Website?** http://www.tcsnycmarathon.org

This was my first marathon ever after starting to take running seriously last summer. I joined the NYRR last November and signed up for my first races in the city. When I got the notification that I had won the 2016 NYC lottery, I was already on my way to a 9+1 guaranteed entry for the marathon for 2017. Today I’m thrilled I will be able to do it again in 12 months! 

### Training
I decided a long time before 18 weeks out that I would be doing the Hanson’s beginner marathon training plan. I bought the book and read it in June. Also in June, I started physical therapy for some hip soreness that often appeared after a run, but never really during it. After a then-PR in mileage during May in preparation for the Brooklyn Half, in June I cut my mpw back to 25-30 or so and then the plan was to slowly build during the first few weeks of the Hanson’s plan in July until I hit the SOS weeks in August. But in July my hip got really bad. The type of pain changed considerably (in intensity, in location, and in what motions caused it to hurt) and my PT said he’d never heard of anyone who had pain like mine before. I took 10 days off of running in weeks 3 and 4 of training, added some yoga and weights to my PT routine, and told myself it would be OK to defer and join in the fun in 2017 for the first time. When I came back, I did many of the miles in the next two weeks on the treadmill (which was not just out of a desire to lessen impact, but also because the air outside felt as thick and as hot as soup). When the SOS runs came around in week 6, I was ready to tackle them and wasn’t feeling any more hip soreness. 

Throughout most of the rest of my training, I was very consistent, hitting the mileage and pacing goals in the plan precisely, or as to be expected given the heat, until I took a day off due to a cold five weeks out. But the cold didn’t get better. I went to the doctor and got inhalers to help with the never-ending cough. Then, a few days later, I realized I now had a sinus infection. I took three days off and got back out there with what I thought was just a little cough from a post-nasal drip. A few days later, I started coughing to the point that I was in tears from the pain in my ribs and ended up in urgent care where I was diagnosed with bacterial bronchitis. That was October 20th. I took an entire week off, a week that was meant to be the final week of my Hanson’s plan before the 10-day taper. A week later I was seriously considering deferring because my ribs still hurt a lot and I still had a bit of a cough, but I came back for three easy runs, then went to see the doctor again who told me that my lungs were clear, the ribs were just bruised, and I wouldn’t do lasting damage to either if I decided to run. It was like a weight was lifted off my chest. I was elated, and I finished the final days of taper as planned.

After being sick for so long, I decided to not think about pace and recalibrate my goals.

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A |Finish | *Yes* |
| B |Without walking | *Yes* |
| C |Without going to the medical tent | *Yes* |

### Pre-race
I got up at 6, had some coffee and oatmeal. Foam rolled, got dressed, grabbed my bag, and was out the door by 7. Then, the slowest transportation experience EVER. Even though I waited 15 minutes for a train, I was still at the ferry terminal for my scheduled ferry. But on the Staten Island side I waited to use the bathrooms in the ferry terminal, then waited about 40 minutes to board a bus. Then was on the bus for about another 40 minutes. I realized that I was going to miss my wave. In fact, I got to Fort Wadsworth and walked directly to the Wave 4 Blue Corral A, which was closed just minutes after I arrived. I’m not sure what happened to the huge sea of runners who were still waiting for busses when I got on mine. Runners around me who had done the race before remarked how bad/slow the bussing situation was this year.

### Miles [1] to [2]
What became a bit frustrating later—that I was behind runners whose paces are much slower than mine—was probably a great thing on the bridge. Took it easy, doubled back several yards to retrieve a water bottle that fell out of a belt of a runner ahead of me then sprinted to catch up to her again. Enjoyed the views of the city.

### Miles [3] to [13]
Just into Brooklyn somebody yelled encouragement with my name. I was surprised that a friend made it down that far, but then I realized that they were responding to my name written out with duct tape on my shirt. That was the best thing I did for myself throughout all the marathon prep. For most of the next 24 miles, it felt like I had a few thousand friends cheering me on. Some even pretended like they were my friends waiting to see just me on the course and got super excited to see me run by. It was delightful.

Throughout the race, I fueled with 3 or 4 Honey Stinger Chews every three miles, and got water or sometimes a Gatorade at every stop except mile 25.

But back to Brooklyn. A lot of the orange wave runners by me cut the course when it met up with my blue wave but then veered off again. A bit of a logistics fail because it seemed like maybe it wasn't clearly marked. The music was great along the course, and the crowds were, too. I hugged friends at miles 6.5 and 11.5 and just settled into a comfortable pace. When we hit Pulaski Bridge, a lot of people around me started walking, and continuing to make forward progress at my pace became a game of dodging people at times from there on out. At some point I nearly landed a foot on a dead, smushed rat. So New York. But I was feeling strong and smiling ear-to-ear.

### Miles [13] to [15]
Queens was uneventful. And the Queensborough Bridge, which I have run several times before, was just as expected: quiet with a long incline. I still felt very relaxed and strong, but had to get around the runners that were walking.

### Miles [16] to [19]
I had friends and family at three locations along 1st Avenue. I missed one of them because the crowds were so thick. About a block away from my apartment I saw my partner, my parents, and another friend and started to get really emotional. My mom said I went by so fast that she didn’t even see me as she was trying to focus her camera. My dad said that I looked like the only person that went by them in the 20-30 minutes they were out there that was still having fun.

### Miles [20] to [21]
The Bronx was a bit quieter than I expected.

### Miles [22] to [24]
Still smiling going down (but really up) 5th Avenue towards the park. Passed my family and friend again. I head some other spectator say, “QsGirl is still strong!” as I ran by. But giving high fives or even turning my head to acknowledge encouraging spectators felt a bit tiring. I was still smiling, though!

### Miles [24] to [26]
THIS IS NOT FUN! WHY AM I DOING THIS??? I HATE CENTRAL PARK. Why is this mile so long? Seriously, why is this mile so long?

Keep running. You ran 24 miles; you can’t walk now.

### Miles [26] to [26.2]
There’s the finish! I have a kick? I HAVE A KICK! I’m going to throw up! Hang on, you can throw up after the finish.

I didn’t throw up. **Final time: 4:29.09.** Gotta go get the New York Times!

### Post-race
The bag of post-race recovery goodies felt nearly too heavy to carry. All I could think as I walked out of the park was “Oh geez. Where’s the finish line?” The volunteers who so caringly put the heat sheet and the poncho on your shoulders are beautiful angels. As I walked down 72nd Street to meet up with my family, a spectator next to me complained about how much his feet hurt…

### What's next?
I’m taking several days off, but then building back up for one more race in December, and focusing winter training on a fast NYC Half in March. But best of all, yesterday’s marathon completed my 9+1 for guaranteed entry in the 2017 NYC marathon, and I can’t wait!

190,Calling health department on neighbor?,58,ja6nd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/ja6nd3/calling_health_department_on_neighbor/,12,1602563835.0,"My neighbor is a lunatic. She obviously suffers from substance abuse/addiction(which I don’t judge her for. It is what it is) ... but these past few months I have witnessed her get into borderline physical altercations with her mid/late 70 year old mother. Her mom often comes and drops off items to my neighbor and takes her to & from the house. Typically these interactions ALWAYS end in arguments between the two of them. The daughter refusing to get out of the car and airing all of their dirty laundry. I have called the cops 2 or 3 times, but have since stopped since nothing is ever done. 

She has a dog like Lassie(so think rough collie). The dog is sweet, barks a lot but other than that is cute to look at. Last winter I noticed that she would let the dog out, and I assume would pass out(?) and forget, because the dog would begin barking and whining to come back into the house. I began having concerns about the dog when he ran over to me one day and I noticed how matted he was. Especially near his butt. I was questioning whether he could even properly use the bathroom because it was so bad. I brought up this concern to her mother and a few days later I saw her outside giving the dog a bath & brushing him. And then they took him to what I believe to be the vet. 

For the 3 years I’ve lived here I have not seen a garbage truck come to her house ONCE. I have not seen her take out garbage EVERRR. And I would like to add that she told me she has 3 cats. So in the 3 years of me living here. I have serious questions about whether or not her animals are living in a clean environment or not. Because where is all the cat litter? Recently I saw that her mom & a few men have been coming to and from the house and taking a few trash bags out. Being nosy and listening to one of their arguments I learned that the mother almost lost the house because when the police+paramedics came to do a wellness check and saw what the inside of the house looks like. Welllllll. Fast forward to the past month. I’ve noticed the trash just piling outside the front of her house & on her driveway. There must be at least 6 or 7 pales of cat litter. At first I thought someone would come grab the trash but nobody has. Normally I would mind my business until one day the porch light turned on & I looked to see 2 HUGE RATS on my front porch. And I mean like NYC Rats. I am beginning to have concerns about whether or not her leaving all of that garbage in her driveway is what is attracting them. 

Over the years living here I’ve seen small mice, moles, raccoons, skunks, deer & even a black bear once. But never a rat. 

I’m definitely thinking about calling the health department & possibly even animal control because of my concern for her pets. I just need advice on how to go about it? Should I reach out to the mother first?"

**Reminders:**

Feedback can make or break a fic. Please take a moment to give the authors you read a reply!

In particular, please note the new **[New Author]** tag on fics and give these folks a warm welcome to writing in our little fandom!

Check out the new, permanent listing of all the fic tagged as having ships in my database: [Worm Shipfic!](http://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/worm/ship.html)

That list'll get updated each week automatically when I do these weekly what's new posts. But this isn't magic. If the fic wasn't posted on FFNet or AO3 with shipping metadata, I'll never know. That's where YOU come in! If you read a fic and it ends up ship-focused and it's not on the list? Let me know! I'll get it updated so everyone else can share in the shippy goodness!

**As always:**

* You can contact me by commenting on a thread, or DMing me on [SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/conversations/add?to=iarna), [SV](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/conversations/add?to=iarna), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=iarna), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iarna_of_fandom).
* Got your first fanart, or added an image to your fic? Drop me a note and I'll make sure it shows up that way.
* Finished your fic? Edit the title of your thread to include the word completed, or drop me a note and I'll be sure to include you in the completed-fics section!
* Don't have a description in my listing? Drop me a note and I'll add whatever you like.
* Same goes for changes! I'm happy to update anything you'd like about your fic, from exact title, to tags to description.

**This week:**

Ok, I've been sitting on this all day, I should really let it out even if I have less than usual to say. XD

Oh, I do have one, [Worm Respun](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/worm-respun-a-peggy-sue-story.523987/) woke back up after a bit over three months with a new chapter. If you've forgotten, it's the fic w/ Noelle-fight era Skitter gets pushed back in time to her first meeting with Emma and Sophia, and things take a radically different turn… (I'd just use short hand and say it's a [Peggy Sue](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue) fic, but folks get that confused with [Mary Sue](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue) and they really have nothing to do with one another.

i'm feeling more and more suicidal by the day because i cannot, for the life of me, get a fucking job.

i am turning 29 next March. my life has played out in ways i did not expect and it all started when i began college in 2011.

i'm an only child. my dad died when i was 13 years old and i've lived with my single mom. i have no family in the usa and was alward pretty much a loner. i was always a dreamy, more melancholy-type, who had huge aspirations and desire to be a successful fashion photographer. i wasn't a great student in high school, so i worked my ass off in community college in order to transfer into a 4 year uni. born and raised in CA, i dreamt of going far away and starting a new life in nyc. i got into my dream schools, parsons and nyu, and decided to go with nyu. 

that is when everything changed for the worse. i wish i never left CA.

i pursued my photography degree (absolutely stupid, i know) at nyu and it was some of the worst years of my life. after my first year, i took a year off and went back home and worked a part-time job while trying to figure out if i should return or transfer elsewhere. i decided to transfer to a tiny liberal arts college in north carolina and pursue journalism. that is where i came close to my first suicide attempt. i had a huge nervous breakdown one day after classes and called the hotline while sobbing on my bathroom floor with a blade in my hands. i was so naive and blind, that i didnt' realize they would call the cops and have them take me to the hospital like i was some fucking dangerous criminal. i was absolutely humiliated being driven in a cop car when i was at my lowest moment. 

i remember just not being able to stop crying. i cried and cried in the hospital bed while the nurse made me sign papers i couldn't even read. a young guy doctor came in and told me ""it will get better, i promise"". i was then taken to a psych ward where i was woken up every morning at 4am in order to get my blood drawn. no joke. it was traumatizing and i had no idea i was being admitted in the first place. i spent a week there after begging to be released. it cost me thousands of dollars afterwards. so all this shit about ""reaching out"" and ""people will help you"" is fucking nonsense. the system is horribly broken; i left more traumatized than when i went in. 

i left north carolina after that and transferred to u of oregon where i tried to pursue the same degree in journalism. i started to have doubts and didn't feel very passionate about the subject or program, and decided to just go back to nyu and finish my degree there. i fucking regret it. i regret it so, so much. i had the absolute worst ""professors"" imaginable. they couldn't care less about me, my work, my future, my dreams, my hopes. my program was filled with trust fund kids who loved to kiss each other's' asses. i couldn't fit in and i really didn't want to anyway. i'll never forget how fucked over i was by the dean who organized the final portfolio reviews: she paired me with the worst people at the review, those who had absolutely NOTHING to do with the type of photography i practiced. i felt so angry and embarrassed when one of my reviewers looked at my work in confusion, asking ""why are you showing ME your work?"" i was purely fucked over by nyu, and i learned NOTHING. zero.

i have had a total of 5 internships, ALL UNPAID. i was told ""get a degree, get internships and you'll get in"". it's all fucking lies. yeah, i got a job a vogue after graduating, but it was FREELANCE, meaning no benefits and no official work station. i was treated like a  fucking rat and was kicked off my assigned desk within two weeks to go work in a phone closet with a broken computer. i ended up quitting via email like an idiot because i was so unhappy and became incredibly sick. 

my mom decided to leave the US and sell our house in CA. she went back to poland, a place i absolutely can't stand. i spent one of the darkest years of my life there, coming close to suicide once again when finally i asked a family friend back in CA if i could just stay with her while i try to find a job there. i spent a year applying for jobs and having one for a few months with a horribly toxic boss and environment. i quit and tried to find something, ANYTHING, else, and failed.

i flew back to poland, back ""home"" to be at my mom's because i couldn't feel good about staying at a friend's place any longer. i got a job finally in switzerland, which was an actual dream come true for me. i really loved it there and felt like the job was doable and ok...until my asshole colleague started to bully me. literally, bully me. i tried to make it work, i tried to go to my manager, my department head...but nobody helped me. i started experiencing panic attacks on a weekly basis and would take sick leaves because i couldn't handle the toxic work environment because of this fucking asshole. i tried to find other work in switzerland, but it's incredibly difficult there, and i failed.

i decided to quit because i mentally couldn't handle it anymore and left. to my surprise, i ended up getting a job in london, and felt excited about it because my boyfriend at the time lived there too. within a week of working there, i found out the job was not right: i was situated in a basement with no windows and was stuck working with another bully. i kid you not, i couldn't believe i was in another bully situation. from one to another...i didn't feel strong enough to endure this. i just came from a year of dealing with this shit, and to go into another situation like this? no. i can't. so, one day i had a panic attack and the same day, my boyfriend broke up with me because he said he "" wasn't ready for this type of commitment"". 

i was devastated and shocked. this is where i fell into one of my deepest suicidal depressive episodes. i cried going to bed, i cried waking up. i posted to my private instagram expressing my devastation, my desperation for help, and i got shockingly negative responses. people were angry at me for being ""weak"" for being self-pitying. people were blaming me for all of it. 

when i hear people who try to encourage those of us struggling to ""reach out"" i want to fucking scream. when i've reached out, i've been met with criticism, with judgment. i've been told ""that's a bit extreme"" or ""you're being negative"" or ""you're self-pitying"". how does any of this help?

i tried to find another job in london, even waitressing, but couldn't land anything. so, i flew back to poland to be home.

since then, i have been NON-STOP applying for jobs. my mom has finally decided to leave poland and go back to the US, which means i'm going back to the us too...but not CA. CA has always been my dream, it's my home. but it's too fucking expensive now. we looked and looked but couldn't find anything we could afford and would feel comfortable living in. so we went with austin because it's more affordable and seems to have somewhat of a promising outlook. 

so, now we are in transition, but i'm still feeling horrible and hopeless. every day i wake up to rejection emails. literally. i have over 2,103 jobs applied to on LinkedIn. i have reached out to people there who claim to be these linkedin gurus and offer to help jobseekers, but honestly, they're full of it. they all just suck each others' dicks and applaud their repetitive job hunting advice and resume writing services. nobody cares. 

i've emailed hundreds of people only to get ""no"" or silence back. i've contacted people on linkedin only to be ignored. fuck, i even applied for a whole foods position only to be rejected. 

my dream was to be a photographer. that's all i ever wanted. yes i know it's hard. yes i know it's not straight and narrow. yes i know it's about WHO YOU KNOW.

but you know what? i'm tired of this. i'm tired of being at the world's mercy. i'm tired of not having any power over my life and career. i'm tired of sucking everyone's dick just to get NOTHING back. i'm tired of being overlooked, undervalued. i'm tired of being nobody and having nothing to my life or name. i'm completely, utterly hopeless. nothing brings me joy. the few friends i thought i had are nowhere to be found now. and when i learned of their responses to my depression, it made me feel even more alone. 

it's been a year of job hunting and i can't take it anymore. i don't even take pictures anymore. i don't enjoy it. i've tried reaching out to magazines, agencies, etc. and they all ignore me. i deleted my personal instagram after that negative experience, along with my photo work instagram because i couldn't' stand how horrible i felt after seeing all the other photographers out there succeeding. 

i am an utter failure. there's really no hope for me. i thought about  going back to community college just to get an AA in tech to hopefully open some doors for me in the future, but how will i know if i'm even any good at it, or if i'll have any better luck? i absolutely hate being so helpless. this is the worst part about it: how i'm at every single person's mercy out there. recruiters have fucked me over countless times. people in power so quickly forget how it is to be at the bottom. nobody cares. nobody wants to help."

I've begun construction of another temple of the cult of fanfic (in the form of [a Discord server](https://discord.gg/aDUGyH)).  Rather than being specifically tied to a fandom, its tied to my rather specific tastes. It's very much still in beta, but all the same you are welcome to come by and give it a looksy. (I'll keep this link live for a day or two. Once I've gotten a chance to iterate with a smaller crowd, I'll open it up the rest of the way.)

201,[Personal] (A Begrudging) Ode to Acne,45,7cjjpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7cjjpx/personal_a_begrudging_ode_to_acne/,8,1510534496.0,"[I remember seeing a post on here a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/2rx0s4/a_little_bit_of_pep_talk_the_upsides_to_having) that listed the reasons why acne had actually been a bit of a boon for the poster, and it really resonated with me and helped change my mindset a bit. I thought I'd share my own similar list, in the hopes that someone else gets the same benefits from it that I did.

I have had angry, ugly, pizza-rific acne on and off for the last 12 years. It bums me out. It's made me feel like I missed out on aspects of being young. But I also think it's important to acknowledge that having acne has, in a lot of ways, really improved my life. These are some of those ways, and maybe some of you here can relate.

1. **Facing having big ol physical flaws**: this sucks, and 90% of the time it really, really sucks. But I also know that having a zillion zits on my face, feeling like a hideous troll and then against all instinct going out into the world is an experience I never would have had to face without ye olde acne. Feeling vulnerable and gross, and pushing past that and continuing to live your life, is something a lot of us struggle with, and I think builds a lot of character and self-reliance. Getting past that vulnerability is hard, but with acne  it basically forces your hand to deal with it because of the high visibility of your face.


2. **Self acceptance** : on that note, acne has taught me a lot about the pointlessness of perfection, and that this is my goddamn face, warts and all (harhar). My skin isn't being bad, or misbehaving, or a sign that I'm a fuck up. It's a face, it's doing its best, and goddamn, if someone in this world thinks I look gross and avoids me? That is more of an issue of them being a small minded, and I'm better off with them avoiding me anyways.

 
3. **I'm a healthy mother f*er (who still has acne) now**: before constantly trying to improve my skin, I straight up did not give a shit about my health. Granted, I was a tween and basically had the hygiene skills of an NYC subway rat, but I look back at all the changes I've made to my life in the effort to clear up my face, and I'm basically Chris Traeger : always drinking water, all the vitamins, less sugar and refined foods, clean sheets and towels all the time - without the mission to keep my skin healthy, I might be doing half these things, if any. 


4. **Changing disordered eating**: I'm not sure how relatable this one is, but for many years I'd undereaten and restricted my food. I've been on the path of changing that, and I've found that focusing on the idea of getting the right nutrition to keep my skin (and other organs, shout out to the other organs) healthy keeps me from cruel to myself and has made me overall more conscientious of my body's needs. 


5. **Big Health Things (TM)** : Probably the most significant here for me , but it was in an effort to understand my acne that I wound up speaking to a doctor and eventually being diagnosed with PCOS. I'm really not sure I would have known if it wasn't for my discomfort with pimples getting all up in my business, so it's worth mentioning. 


6. **You are now about to witness the strength of skin knowledge** : I basically know a fuck ton about skin and skin products now. It's unlikely I would have ever delved into the world of moisture barriers and pH without acne as my prompt. I like to think this makes me a bit more intelligent than I was before. 


So I guess at the end of it all, my quest to fix something on my skin has actually really changed me mentally and emotionally. I am less focused on my physical perfection. I care for myself. I'm SUPER moisturized. And I've been told my face smells good. So thank you, acne, you stupid fuck. Against your best wishes, I have benefited in important ways from carrying you around. 


Maybe folks on here have their own things that have changed for the better at the behest of the canary in the coal mine of acne, if you do I'd be happy to add to this list."
202,the rat’s verse on sweet from nyc night 1,43,e0zni7,https://v.redd.it/30w844efhn041,3,1574608389.0,
203,There is a group of people who get together weekly to hunt rats with their dogs in NYC,40,1ez521,http://twentytwowords.com/2013/05/01/rat-hunting-with-dogs-in-new-york-city-alleys-pictures-video/,17,1369410072.0,
204,Theory: Titus is the main character,43,7z4kqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/KimmySchmidt/comments/7z4kqs/theory_titus_is_the_main_character/,4,1519208552.0,"I think Titus is, compared to Kimmy, much more compelling and relateable, and therefore I believe the true messages of the show are told through his journey, rather than Kimmy's:

-Kimmy is a cartoon, sometimes literally, her life is a fantasy. Her experiences, even the real ones where she grows as a person, are told through this Disneyesque lens that seems like a coping mechanism more than reality.
-Titus, on the other hand, while also often absurd (it's a Fey show, it's going to be goofy) experiences character growth that is much more grounded in reality- his struggle to find validation of his talents, specifically regarding his jobs, and his learning that love is unselfish and painful when it makes you confront your own flaws and limitations. These are real truths. Not fantasy like we see again and again with Kimmy's absurd synchronistic experiences.

His are more universal and grounded story arcs. I'm much more interested to see what happens to Titus compared to Kimmy. Kimmy just happens to be a rowing prodigy and gains full scholarship to Columbia? Give me a break. How about Titus realizing he is less intimidating as a werewolf than a black man? That's a legitimately thought-provoking event.

Kimmy is going to be fine. That much is clear from the first episode, when she leaves the Mole Women to find a new way to live her life. Titus is almost the foil to that, having once shared her starry-eyed enthusiasm for life (when he's flashing back to roller-skate-clad Ronald Wilkerson), he has been beat down again and again by the harsh realities of life, amplified through the dog-eat-rat setting of NYC (sidenote, quit pretending greenpoint is the uws, showrunners).

What I'm trying to say is that Titus is a much deeper character, more relateable to the story at large (how NYC, and the world in general is complicated and demands fortitude and self-actualization for a truly meaningful life). 

I don't know about you, but his ""parody"" of All Night gives me the feels like nothing else in the show so far, perhaps with the exception of Jacqueline/Jackie Lynn's reevaluation of her own identity and responsibility to her own destiny. 

I'd say since they share at least equal screen time, that the show is truly about Titus and will culminate with his evolution into a more selfless and humble human being."
205,Ouija Board Art Project - Work In Progress (Part2),44,3w1ns9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3w1ns9/ouija_board_art_project_work_in_progress_part2/,17,1449645293.0,"It's been a few days since I posted the strange things happening around my unfinished Ouija Board and I wasn't planning on doing an update until it was actually finished, but something weird happened not too long ago.  I think I really scared one of my classmates and I feel really bad. [Here's the first part of my story](https://wh.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3vmzuh/ouija_board_art_project_work_in_progress/), It has pictures of my Ouija board! and basically it's just some funny coincidences taking place from my stress and lack of sleep over final projects.  This Ouija board being my final project for my sculpture class.

Nothing really happened Sunday or Monday, except for dreamless nights again.  Another thing to note maybe, I'm a heavy sleeper but I don't usually sleep in.  Sunday I had to have slept for 12+ hours which is unreal for me, and I remember waking up to the cities church bells around noon.  I felt really tired like I didn't sleep at all, but the rest of the day was really peaceful.  

Monday was peaceful too, I was in the class all day so that might have something to do with it.  Stressing over my drawing final, another huge project.  Tuesday, today, is actually my day off.  I decided to take the Ouija board cross town to my sculpture class and get some early work done on it.  When I was in the subways station, I like to play a game of trying to find as many rats as I could.  Most of the time I can't find any, especially since it's getting closer to winter here in NYC, but I found one this time, and it weird because this rat was staring right at me.  It wasn't moving.  I've never seen that happen before.  This rat was kind of close though, so maybe I freaked it out but I always see them minding their own business.  It wasn't moving at all, just staring at me, even when the train was rolling up it didn't skitter away or anything.  The part I still have burnt into my brain was just as the train was coming up, I saw a figure of a second rat further away, just staring at me as well.  The train snapped me out of it when I couldn't see the rats anymore, but two of them staring at me?  Or at least I think they were.  It felt weird holding the Ouija board after that, but I finally made my way to the class room.  

So here's the thing, I honestly forget if I mentioned this in the first part, but I'm working with a team, two other people.  Most of my class are Chinese foreigners, and I love them all.  Super nice and hard workers.  Only a few of them have a real communication problem, but my favorite part is that they are unfamiliar with western ghost stories just like how we are unfamiliar with Chinese fables and other things.  I'm happy to say I'm learning a lot from them.  I'm only throwing this out there because both of my class mates are Chinese and super excited to make an Ouija board, even though they know nothing about it, they just think it looks cool.

Moving on, I'm in the sculpture class working late with a few other people on our homework.  (Not my team mates)  We talk about random things until it starts getting late and the conversation turns to my Ouija board.  Only one of the people in this room actually believes the stuff, but everyone else is excited and wanted to try it tonight before we left.  I told them it wasn't finished, I didn't even make the Planchette yet (The thingy that moves around the board).

As I was saying this, another classmate went into the wood scraps, grabbed an already triangular piece of wood, and I saw her sand it a bit and drill a hole through the center in less than 5 minutes.  ""There!""  I got to hand it to her, she's good in the shop.  So I said yes, let's talk to ghosts then.


This next part I'm about to describe is still freaking me out a bit, I'm not sure if it was anyone else joking around and messing with her or if she was doing it on her own just to mess with us.  Either way, she seemed genuinely frightened by the end of it all.

So, there's five of us using the board, including me sitting at the bottom of the board near “Goodbye”.  One other onlooker, the guy I mentioned before that actually believes this stuff, he didn't want to touch the board at all, so I asked him if he could at least write the letters down, he said sure.

We were all set in the corner of the big sculpture room, and it was almost empty too.  I think there was just a couple other people from other classes working on their projects.  The girl to my right (J) eas the one that actually made the Planchette and she put her fingers on it first.  Then I did, then everyone else.  I asked, ""Who wants to ask the question first?"" ""Me!"" says J.  And I swear I felt the Planchette move for the first time, as if towards her voice.  Maybe it was the others adjusting their fingers, but I know I have mine on there as light as a feather.  It must have been really subtle though because no one else seemed to notice. 

So I remember her taking a while to think of a question, and finally she asks, ""Is there anyone here right now, Because of the Ouija board?""  I thought it was a weird question to add ""because of the Ouija board, but before I could ask why she added that, the wood harshly and very slightly scraped towards ""YES"".  I wasn't that surprised.  I was more creeped out by how the crude Planchette felt against the unfinished wood of the board.  I plan on vanishing it and maybe giving it a very slick amber resin finish... smooth as a babies butt. 

There were giggles, mostly from the Chinese girls.  I'm happy they enjoyed it, but J was really getting into it.  Before I could even think of something to ask it, she asked ""Did you die here?""  like damn.. slow down?  Getting a little personal, but the Planchette moved to ""NO"".  That answer did surprise me.  Again giggles.  I don't think the Chinese students even understood the questions, but J looked a bit weirded too.  ""Where are you from then?""  Asked the guy across from me, and like me, he's a skeptic.  He seemed to be getting into it too.  The board moved, and this time a little quickly, but it didn't make any sense, it was trying to spell something.  ""D"" ""X"" ""E"" ""Y"" ""A"" and as it was moving across the board, J asked something else, ""Are you a ghost?"".  It stopped, it wasn't moving anymore, and it was awkwardly silent.  I won't lie, at this point I was feeling a little tense and I tried to nudge it slightly upwards but it was as if it was glued to the wood.  I was a bit taken aback by that.  So at this point the guy writing all this down tries saying something, but just as he says ""I think-"" the Planchette moves again, slowly, towards ""NO"". 

It gives me shivers writing this again.  At this point I remember the mood changing, feeling gross...  The Chinese students weren't laughing anymore, maybe something made them feel weird too?  Again I was thinking of something to ask, and so was J I think, because I could see a concerned look on her face.  The gears were definitely turning in her head.  Before anyone could speak, the Planchette moved again.  It gave us ""O"" ""U"" and then it almost went off the board on the right side but it stopped, then went back to ""O"".  It was still moving when for some reason I asked, ""Can you prove you actually exist and that it's not just us moving a piece of wood?"" and, even though it felt like a clever question to ask, when the Planchette drastically stopped like it did, it felt like I interrupted something I shouldn't have, as if the weight of a thousand eyes were now on me.  I felt heavy and it was not at all a pleasant feeling.  It got worse too.. 

The Planchette moved again, but it slowly creeped up to ""NO"", and before I could let out a sigh, it was moving again.  First ""D"" then ""R"", ""E"" ""A"" ""M"".  

I'm shivering as I type this.  Like I'm about to throw up just remembering it.  It spelt ""No DREAM"".  I must have looked shocked because everyone just looked confused and they were staring at me.  So I lied.  

I asked, ""What does that mean?""  ""My buddy across from me even said, ""It's a game, we spelt dream, like you know, just dream up stuff to say.""  It helped bring me back to reality.. just a little.  Seriously, what the fuck.  I haven' told anyone other than these reddit posts that I haven't been having any dreams lately.  That's so creepy.  

J asked it, ""What do you want?""  but I remember that felt so distant, my heart was still pounding.  The Planchette moved, ""O"" ""U"" then it went down to the bottom right corner, almost falling off again.  Then back up to ""N"" ""O"" then the bottom right corner.  It was moving faster than before, going to ""O"" ""U""  then ""N"" ""O"".  As it was picking up more speed, I remember hearing one of the Professors tell us that the shop was closing soon, and I saw it finally move to spell a couple words.  ""O"" ""U"" ""R"" ""S"" ""N"" ""O"" ""W"" and it quickly went down, just to the right of Goodbye, completely falling off the board towards J.  So we decided to end it.  

As I was packing up and putting my things away.  J came up to me, and she looked really worried.  She asked, ""Did you see it go to goodbye at the end?"" and I should have said yes.. but I wasn’t thinking, I was just being honest.  It went to the right of Goodbye, not even touching it, it went straight at J, and falling off of the board.  That's what I saw.  She said she saw the same thing and she just wasn't sure because usually you're suppose to say ""Goodbye"" before closing or something like that.  I told her to not worry about it, but I can tell from her face that she was worried.  

I left the board there...  I'll be working on it more tomorrow, most likely finishing it and creating a professional Planchette.  But I still feel sick.  I'm sure she's asleep by now, but I think I'll message J too, see how she's doing.  Either way, scary experience, fun stuff.  Hopefully we can talk to some less creepy ghosts next time.  

Oh yah, one last thing.  My friend told me about this Friday.  It's a ""New Moon"" and I guess that's a good time for stronger spiritual connections.  That might be a better time to use the Ouija board."

I was absolutely enthralled with the staggering amount of character this city has. Even the subway, though stifling at times (it's ridiculously hot) had its charm. I think it's the only place where rats scurrying about carrying slice's of pizza seems normal and not revolting. I don't know what it is about the city, but all the small things in life that seem to annoy me all add to NYC's charm. There is so much to do, so much history, so much vibrance. I love this place."
