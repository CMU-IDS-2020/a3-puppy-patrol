I live on a street with a full tree canopy overhead, I'm less than a minute walk from a huge park with wide open fields, forests, and ponds, as well as sports facilities for soccer, baseball, football, tennis, ice hockey, etc. I'm also less than a minutes walk from a subway that can take me to the heart of the city in 20 minutes, or to the beach in 20 minutes. Most things I ever need are available within walking distance. 

In the summer there are free outdoor concerts, theatre, and other performances pretty much every day somewhere in the city, often by popular artists that usually charge big bucks for tickets. There are countless museums, and some of the most important collections are completely free to see. There is a scene for pretty much any type of art or music.

There is a community for pretty much any language or culture in the world, meaning that there are restaurants and shops representing most any cultures in the world. 

Bars and clubs are open until 4am, and there are after hours places for those drug addled partiers that need to keep it going until the middle of the next day. In the summer you can even go to parties hosted by the museum of modern art, with great live music, booze, and art installations. 

Kids have access to great public schools, and can choose between a variety of high schools. You don't have to worry about your kid dying in a drunk driving accident, because at worst they pass out drunk on the subway.

You also don't have to worry much about crime, because it is among the safest cities in the country.

There is a specialty store for pretty much anything as well, whether its for your hobby or your profession. 

It isn't for everyone, and it is a very competitive place‚Äîbut people who are passionate and ambitious don't want to be a big fish in a small pond, they want to be around others who stimulate their passion and push them further in it.

Forced perspective is a technique which employs optical illusion to make an object appear farther away, closer, larger or smaller than it actually is. It manipulates human visual perception through the use of scaled objects and the correlation between them and the vantage point of the spectator or camera. It has uses in photography, filmmaking and architecture.

A rat king is a collection of rats whose tails are intertwined and bound together by one of several possible mechanisms, such as entangling material like hair or sticky substances like sap or gum. The number of rats joined together varies from a few to as many as 32. Historically, the phenomenon is particularly associated with Germany, which produced many reported instances. Rat kings occur so rarely that they have sometimes been thought to be cryptids, but there are several well-attested modern occurrences.

I assume you meant Manhattan, as that‚Äôs what most people think of when they hear ‚ÄúNYC‚Äù and I‚Äôll concede, Manhattan has gone DOWN THE DRAIN in the last decade. It is no longer safe. It is no longer clean. And it is extremely overpriced. 

I live a 15 minute train ride from the economic capital of the country, and I only actually find myself in Manhattan 3-4 times a year. 

If you want a better idea of New York City, the NYC most New Yorkers know, visit Queens. We have the beaches in Rockaway. We have the World Fair in Flushing Meadows. We have the ‚Äúreal‚Äù China town also in Flushing, where it actually feels like you‚Äôre in a different country. We have Muslim and Jewish neighborhoods, both with delicious cuisine. There‚Äôs Astoria which is great Hispanic neighborhood. Long Island City is also a growing tourist destination with great parks and views of the bridges and the river. All while being world‚Äôs cheaper and cleaner than Manhattan. 

I‚Äôll admit, there isn‚Äôt a LOT to see in Queens, but it‚Äôs much closer to the life most New Yorkers live. And I haven‚Äôt even touched upon Brooklyn or the Bronx. If you want my advice I‚Äôd say stay closer to the Brooklyn Bridge if you do visit Brooklyn, because it can get real sketchy in areas like East New York, but if you go in the day time and stick to the tourist spots you should be fine. Most of it is also just a copy and paste of Queens anyways. The Bronx is also nice and has great parks as well, although, I‚Äôll admit, even I don‚Äôt visit the Bronx that often.

Oh, also, Staten Island is pretty nice too, I go to watch minor league baseball every once in a while over there and the Ferry is completely free. The island often gets overlooked lol


So yes, the city is going down the drain, especially with DeBlasio as mayor and these lockdowns that are absolutely decimating the local businesses. But if we make it through this, as a city, you should give the city a second (third , fourth or whatever) chance. Sure, visit Manhattan, go see the south street seaport.

At the same time, don‚Äôt underestimate the intelligence of millions of people who live in New York. They are choosing New York, despite the fact that it is overpriced. Perhaps they think it‚Äôs worth it?  Have you asked why?

Like all big cities (e.g., London, Paris, Moscow, Tokyo, Shanghai), New York is more expensive than small towns where you can get a bigger place, access to nature, etc. 

People like New York because it offers more opportunities. More career opportunities, not only well paying jobs to get started but also to switch jobs or start your own firm.

There are also more social opportunities, with a lot of folks from all over the world and very easy ability to see friends as much as you like.

And lastly NYC offers great cultural options. Shows, restaurants, museums, galleries, political talks, etc.

Having said all that, the last 6 months, New York has been crap. Lots of people moved out, cultural options are mostly closed and most well paying jobs can be done remotely. If this continues for another year, chances are New York won‚Äôt be what it was and will start sliding on attractiveness scale, like it did in the 1970s.

Calling bullshit on this one. I spend time in NYC every year for work/fun. You can buy a 6-pack of bud lite and have it fucking delivered for $13. The amount of bullshit in this sub is insane. 

A ""luxury"" burger at black-tap is $18.

Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore, Taipei brought be the greatest experiences ever and so last year I decided to pay New York a visit. Unlike the other mentioned cities, NYC proudly claim to be the capital of the world and such and I really believed it because of how NYC is portrayed in media. 

Ho boi. I'm so sorry New Yorkers but as a traveler, my traveling expeience in NYC was terrible. Subways were old, rusty, dirty, stinky, hot, dark with long wait time and several times trains didn't even have air con or fans on. Everyone was sweating, the steam was visible and it was like a stinky sauna. I remember the blonde lady next to me told me that it was a normal thing in NY... The price of everything was extremely high, but the customer service was horrible. The only nice waiter I saw was in a TGIF, I didnt forget to tip him generously. The streets were full of trash, the air smelt like vomit and poop. At late night, the roads and subway stations were trash infested. Remind you I come from a developing country, yet my alley is way cleaner than Manhattan. 

I also got to see, with my very own eyes, drunk/crazy dude screaming on the road, some guy was dancing on their own and vomited right on the pavement and another one just squat down and p... pooped on the ground, near the big station area...

However there were some nice things I did love about NYC. Subway was a bit outdated but very convenient. I really like the museums and Central Park. They were really interesting and every cent was worth it. The many shopping malls and Times Square area were fun and flashy.

It really is a shitty place that's still coasting on its reputation from decades ago. There's really nothing left there industry-wise to make it the center of the universe anymore. The last thing New York had was Wall Street and that's also slowly going away. Traders don't even trade in the exchange anymore. It's become a glorified showpiece museum.

I laugh at people who still defend it and claim it's the greatest place on earth. Just a bunch of sheep programmed to repeat the same dogma that's been drilled into their heads their whole lives. The same people who vote stairway to heaven as the best classic rock song of all time on q104.3 because they don't have any analytical thoughts of their own.

New york arrogance just isn't backed up by the city's exploits anymore. The rest of the world has gone from admiring to laughing at new york, and those who still defend it are too blind to see it. 

And as all the billionaires flee like rats from a sinking ship, it's going to be a sad thing to witness as the city's revenue goes away with them. Seinfeld defending NY was the funniest joke he's come up with since leaving his sitcom considering he was holed up in the Hamptons during peak pandemic.

Thoughts - Mix of Pros and Cons 

A. I found the whole double parking on one side of the sidewalk for the street cleaning to be uniquely NYC. I have been to all 50 states and have never seen that. 

B. Trash on the sidewalks. Not a fan. 

C. All the African-Americans in Harlem were the coolest folks. Always helped me when driving got too tight or I was having trouble with parallel parking. I actually found the Puerto Ricans in the Bronx to be mean mugging me way more. One guy crossed the sidewalk on my green, purposely slowed down, and just mugged me like some ""this is my neighborhood"" power move. 

D. I brought my own car to NYC and had no problem finding free street parking for a month. 

E. Subway crazies. Compare it to the subway in Toronto, Canada. Toronto's is far cleaner, wider, and chill. A Canadian told me it is because they have socialized medicine so their people can get proper mental healthcare. I know it is more complex than that. But it makes sense. 

F. Dirty buildings and grimey feel. Can conform. 

G. In the late Spring, Manhattan and Central Park seemed to be filled with European tourists. I think the glamorized image that Hollywood puts out sticks in the minds of those aborad. Classicists in every country want to come here b/c it is a status symbol to be there. Regular folks want to be there because it is just what you do when you come to the USA. 

H. No one in NYC likes Staten Island. I went there myself. I agree. Quaint place and some good neighborhoods. 

I. Expensive food. Near Times Square (3 blocks) and paid $30 for a Reuban Sandwich at a Deli. Consider me shocked. The guy did not even blink when I challenged him on the price. Super NYC hustle. 

J. The lonliest I have ever felt in a big city. And I lived with two businesswomen from Europe and one deranged professor in a BnB. 

K. The Chinatown in Manhattan was not impressive. 

L. Getting around without a car was a breeze. Parking was not. 

M. The world comes to you.

N. Overpriced real estate to live in a big name place. Like selling your soul to do a free internship at a big company for the brand recognition on your resume. Except I do not believe everyone needs to live in NYC to get noticed.",t3_ja26if,1602594774.0

And of course an apartment in Chelsea is 750k. You think you‚Äôre going to be The Weeknd‚Äôs neighbor by paying 78k for a studio? Most celebrities own these apartments and really rich investment bankers. Jeff bezos the worlds richest man bought an apartment this summer.

 NYC is not for everyone. It's definitely dirty af and there's rats/pigeons/roaches everywhere. One joke we have is about those scented candles that smell like states, ""the scent of New York!"" - clearly these people didn't live in the city ha! I wish it was clean like Toronto or Singapore (well...Singapore may be too clean but I digress) but it's a microcosm of America and it's issues: lack of funding for infrastructure, maintenance + lack of giving a fuck from its residents. And yes, it's absurdly expensive to the point where I'm paying for half of a tiny apartment for more money than my friend in Austin pays for a house.

It's all about what you value. I don't need a lot of space and dirty streets don't bother me all that much, especially compared to what I get in return:

1. Nightlife. I love being able to walk outside my apartment on any night of the week and grab a drink, see a live band, get amazing food, etc (before corona of course)

2. Food. There's far more articles that explain this better than I can, but the food is legendary. I've had ramen better than I've bad in Tokyo. I've had tacos that a friend from Mexico has insisted were better than any he's had from his home. Pizza? Pfft. No contest. 

3. Diversity. Not just food but the people as well. You can learn so much from the various backgrounds, cultures, stories you hear from people you run into. I've danced with multi-millionaires and had heart to hearts with people who have been homeless. Learned about people's religions and cultures just being at a bar. It's an amazing experience that very few cities can give you. 

4. Hobbies. You want to learn extreme trapeze photography? There's a class in NYC for that. The amount of classes you can try out, skills you can pick up, exercises you can try is truly mind boggling. It's amazing. Anyone who lives here for a while I highly HIGHLY recommend taking a class or two of some sort - cooking, sailing, yoga, dancing, martial arts you name it NYC has a class for it.

5. Culture & Exploration. Museums, Broadway, opera, lectures, poetry, comedy shows, parks, botanical gardens, art galleries, parades, farmers markets...the list goes on forever. There's so much to do and see on a random day (before corona) that even if you have no intention of actually going to any of these places that day, you may end up there anyway just out of curiosity. Just spend a day with the only plan is walking around and exploring an area of New York and see where you end up. Tbe possibilities are endless.",t3_ja26if,1602598699.0

1716,1716,ja26if,g8p1sv9,1,t3_ja26if,"NYC is awesome. I currently live in DC and I've never lived in a more lifeless, joyless car-based 'city.' New York is about mobility, if you stay out of mid-town there are so many wonderful, quiet places to just sit and observe. Plus the cycling is good, too, for a major city.

Also, after living there for a while you meet interesting people, people who work in the arts, who write, who perform. I once had a coffee at a caf√© near NYU and ended up chatting with a diplomat who helped me get into a NYC Government preferred applicant program. Another time, a cousin came to visit and introduced me to an actress who helped me write and direct a one-act play about doomsday preppers. I don't write plays. Where the fuck else can that happen?  

NYC is gritty and stressful, but after some time there's a kind of harmony in that chaos. It feels like a warm blanket. I saw some weird shit, don't get me wrong. I watched a guy in a suit lick a subway pole. One time I was waiting for an airport shuttle and this absolutely zooted homeless mad man cornered and accosted me. Then he looked me in the eyes and said ""Man, I'll fuckin kill you,"" before he scurried away with a memorable gait. He looked like he was stutter stepping to prepare for a leap that he never took. I began laughing immediately. 

Despite the edges, people in New York are friendly. Almost excessively friendly. I can't tell you how many times someone would offer help or ask if I needed anything. The sense of community is based on your presence in this place. (Again, this doesn't exist in mid-town. Stay out of mid-town).  

As for food, there's no place on earth with such an interesting and dynamic range of options. Without much effort you can find an amazing slice of pizza for 2 dollars, Thai for 5 dollars, Ethiopian for under 10, and of course the bagels. There are a ton of amazing dining options throughout New York City, except in mid-town, stay out of mid-town. 

There's no place on earth like New York, and there's a reason it's so expensive. The next time you go, check out the upper west side, The Highline, The Whitney, Hell's Kitchen, Harlem, Crown Heights in BK, Prospect Park, Central Park, the IFC Theater, hell even Jersey City and Hoboken are worth seeing.  

Of course, judging NYC during the pandemic isn't really fair. The place thrives on closeness, small shared interior spaces, face to face conversations with strangers. I confess, most of the charm is dormant now, but I encourage you to give the place another chance after this pandemic is over. The grit that binds that dirty place together is resilience; New York City always comes back.

Chelsea would have old, turn of the last century buildings like that. As to it being dirty, I'm not sure what drugs you were taking during your stay but the city is surprisingly clean compared to what you got during the 70s. Unless you happened to be there during a trash day pick up? Then yes, you will get days where there is trash piled up on the sidewalks in front of buildings because big surprise, the garbage fairy doesn't make it magically disappear, it has to be picked up by DPW.  


If you ate an over priced crappy hamburger, NYC's got tons of awesome, inexpensive restaurants and if you're too stupid to find them, that's on you buddy. But yes, it is an expensive city, I'll give you that. Rents & housing costs are nuts.  


As to the homeless, yeah it's a big city, it has homeless. If you were in Chelsea, then there's a soup kitchen at one of the churches right the, so you'd probably be seeing them.  


I've been to a lot of other cities, and they all have their ups & downs. You mention LA, LA strikes me as a gloried suburb that pretends to be a city. Boston has the same shitty old building problem and if you want to park in Boston you've got to buy a fucking condo just to get a parking pass. Tokyo is ridiculously expensive, more so than NYC, Miami has got serious drug & crime problems, and it comes across as jaded and run down. And DC, DC has got that surreal dividing line between the center, rich area of the city and the poorer areas. It's freakin' creepy. And Frankly, wit the exception of some picturesque areas, it just comes across as downtown business complex blocks.

Manhattan is Built on Landfills

by Daniel R. Lewis

Take a walk along the Hudson River through Battery Park City and up 13th Avenue. You‚Äôll see apartments, offices, warehouses and parks, not to mention the traffic up and down the West Side Highway. It‚Äôs also all built on garbage.

Almost since the first European colonists arrived and began to build a settlement at the southern tip of Manhattan Island, New Yorkers have dealt with two problems: lots of garbage and needing more space. At first, garbage was tossed over the city walls to the north, or simply thrown into the nearby rivers. Out of sight, out of mind. But as the city‚Äôs population grew, so did the amount of trash beyond the walls. With more trash comes more disease and soon enough New York had its first sanitation crisis on its hands.

‚ÄúExperts in landscape architecture, sanitary movement and engineering came together for public health reasons to try to reshape the city,‚Äù said Steven Moga, a fellow at the New-York Historical Society. ‚ÄúMost of the infrastructure that supports life in New York City today dates back to that period and those building decisions were very closely intertwined with filling land.‚Äù

When the city‚Äôs original reservoir, a pond called the Collect, became too polluted by waste from nearby breweries and tanneries, the city decided to just fill it. They piled trash and earth into the pond and built a canal to drain the Collect into the East River. The waterway was itself filled in to create a new road: Canal Street. These days, all that‚Äôs left of the pastoral pond is a small park on the corner of Lafayette Avenue and Leonard Street.

Manhattan has continued to grow along with its population. The most recent addition to the island was Battery Park City, built on top of landfill and waste from the construction of the original World Trade Center in 1973. But it took years to develop, leaving New York with a rarity: wide, open space in lower Manhattan.

‚ÄúThere was a period when development just halted,‚Äù said Lilly Tuttle, an assistant curator at the Museum of the City of New York. ‚ÄúIn the meantime there was a beach there, a vast tract of unused land that was used for performances and public art.‚Äù

Green space and public art has since given way to luxury developments in Battery Park City, but there‚Äôs more to the story of how Manhattan grew on top of garbage in the interactive feature below.

Where Does New York City Garbage Go? [An Animated Journey of 3 Million Tons of Waste]

Mapping the long Journey of New York City‚Äôs solid waste (full screen version)

New York City is a ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù of waste management challenges.

Two waste management systems ‚Äì one public, one private

Today, New York City generates over 14 million tons of trash each year. The amount is so large, the City manages it through two separate systems, one public and one private.

The public system handles waste from residences and government buildings as well as some non-profits. This ‚Äúpublic waste,‚Äù which accounts for about one-quarter of the City‚Äôs total, is collected by New York‚Äôs Department of Sanitation (DSNY), the largest waste management agency in the world with an annual budget of $1.5 billion, greater than the total annual budget of 41 countries.

The other three-quarters of New York‚Äôs garbage is generated by commercial businesses, most of it rubble and debris from construction projects. Collection of this ‚Äúprivate waste‚Äù does not come out of the City‚Äôs budget. Instead, business must pay one of the City‚Äôs 248 licensed waste haulers to take it away.

Overseeing New York‚Äôs private trade waste is the City‚Äôs Business Integrity Commission (BIC), an agency originally created to rid the carting industry of organized crime. Consistent with the Tony Soprano stereotype, New York‚Äôs garbage hauling industry has long had ties to organized crime. Today, this corruptive influence has largely been eliminated, and the BIC‚Äôs primary function is now regulatory oversight and setting price controls.

 

The long journey of New York garbage

Before the trash goes out to the curb for pickup, New York law requires it be separated into three categories: paper, metal/glass/plastic, or mixed solid waste (non-recyclable garbage). Each type of waste is typically collected separately and follows a different path to its ultimate destination, often with several intermediate stops along the way.

As the largest city in the world‚Äôs most wasteful country, New York generates over 14 million tons of trash each year, more than any other city in the world. Not only that, New York is also America‚Äôs densest city. Its narrow, heavily-trafficked streets make collecting all that garbage a logistical Gordian knot. Lastly, New York is located smack dab in the center of the Northeast megalopolis, a giant urban expanse where available land for disposing of garbage is in short supply.

To deal with these challenges, New York relies on a complex waste-management ecosystem encompassing: 2 city agencies, 3 modes of transport (trucks, trains, and barges), 1,668 city collection trucks, an additional 248 private waste hauling companies, and a diverse network of temporary and permanent facilities extending halfway around the world.

 

A brief history of New York‚Äôs waste management

Waste management problems are nothing new for New York. As described in a 1657 ordinance, when New York was still called New Amsterdam,

‚Äú‚Ä¶many burghers and inhabitants throw their rubbish, filth, ashes, dead animals and suchlike things into the public streets to the great inconvenience of the community.‚Äù

A snapshot from two centuries later depicts a city overrun with horse manure, posing a health hazard for residents.

Through most of its history, up until the mid-1900‚Äôs, New York‚Äôs primary method for disposing of its waste was simply to dump it into the ocean. At one point, as much as 80% of New York‚Äôs garbage ended up out at sea. However, in what was surely its most enduring waste management initiative, New York City used some of its garbage (mostly ash, rubble, and other debris) to create artificial land, thereby increasing its own size.

Much of its land today, including some of its priciest neighborhoods, are literally built on garbage.

Each day, New York‚Äôs public garbage trucks collect nearly 7,000 tons of residential mixed solid waste. After finishing their routes, most of these trucks will deposit the garbage in one of New York‚Äôs waste transfer stations located throughout the City. From there, the garbage will eventually be loaded onto a barge or a train and carried as far as 600 miles away to its final stop. For most of New York‚Äôs mixed solid waste (about 80% of it by tonnage), this last stop will be a landfill. The remaining 20% will end up at a waste-to-energy plant, where it will be incinerated and converted into energy.

Paper and metal/glass/plastic waste is brought to one of the City‚Äôs recyclables handling and recovery facilities, specialized plants that separate and sort the recyclable materials. From this point, the journey of New York‚Äôs recyclable waste splits apart into many possible directions. Some of it will be sold to local raw material processors (paper mills, smelters, etc). Some will be exported overseas, most often to China or India. Some will be sold through intermediary waste brokers. And some specific items will be separated and sold directly to their end-users (e.g. crates to a Coca-Cola bottling plant, beer kegs to Anheiser-Busch).
New York‚Äôs solid waste management facilities are required to submit annual reports documenting the source and destination of all incoming and outgoing waste material. Using this data, it‚Äôs possible to construct a reasonably comprehensive picture of the journey taken by New York‚Äôs garbage.

The map at the top is based on data from 2015. Press the play button to see where New York‚Äôs waste goes, starting in the local community district where it originates, on to a temporary transfer station or recyclables recovery facility, and in many cases all the way to its final destination (the paper trail gets spotty after the waste leaves New York). Click on a marker to see the amount of waste that passed through that location in 2015.",t3_ja26if,1602573459.0

I went to Miami in March 2019 to visit family for my birthday. Miami was SOOO clean. Not a single shred of trash on the floor. Everywhere smelled so nice and it was so warm down there. That place was magical. 

The day I came back to NY was the worst day of the vacation. I had to go to the city immediately after I landed. It was soooo cold that the fallen snow turned to slippery ice, the train station was over crowded I could barely get on the train, there was trash all over the train tracks which causes fires and delays, and I even saw the hallmark of NY; rats.

We do also have different cultural areas like Queens and Manhattan, where you can go get anything from a kosher bagel to fresh sushi to mofongo. 

We have Prospect park, Grand Army Plaza with the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Brooklyn Public Library. (Grand army plaza has hosted a ton of BLM protests, marches and demonstrations!) We have the Barclays center too, which was constantly hosting events. There‚Äôs all those weird art galleries by greenpoint on the border of Queens too, and those cute parks that overlook it.

People don't go to New York to live in a large mansion in a cheaper price and have $3 four-course meals. If you want that, buy a forest in Bolivia or Moldova, clear it and set up a mansion there. American dollars will buy you a giant mansion with gardens and butlers and chauffeurs.

2409,2409,ja26if,g8nwx38,101,t1_g8nub53,"Ah you‚Äôre still here? Great! Lol.
Anyways, keep in mind that most of Queens is made up of working/middle-class ethnic populations (I didn‚Äôt even name the Irish, Greeks, Italians, or Koreans lol) and since the parks are meant as a sort of escape from the city for most people, it really isn‚Äôt that shiny, as Manhattan gets most tourist revenue. But give it a shot, especially if you hated Manhattan! 

Also, it‚Äôs important to know that, while public transportation here is really efficient, everything is a lot more spread out than Manhattan, so it won‚Äôt be as easy to get around, especially on a weekday. So access to a car might be helpful. But if that‚Äôs not in the budget, map out a few of the places that I named and see what you can visit. Good luck!

2410,2410,ja26if,g8o2vyf,18,t1_g8nub53,"Dope, go to Van Courtland Park if you haven‚Äôt already. It‚Äôs pretty big and nice this time of the year. I think what people may not realize when coming here is how much each borough differs from one another. Even within the boroughs there‚Äôs big differences between neighborhoods and the west and east sides. People like to shit on places like the Bronx (where I live) and I don‚Äôt disagree that some areas aren‚Äôt the best, but some areas are pretty nice (like van courtland Park). 

Just be careful with getting on trains super late at night, especially if you look like a tourist because people might take advantage of that. Manhattan has gone downhill in the last 10 years and is definitely more expensive. The pandemic certainly hasn‚Äôt helped. 

If it weren‚Äôt for the pandemic I would have recommended going ice skating at Chelsea pier at the sky rink, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the best idea now. But yeah there are a lot of things New York City has to offer outside of manhattan and even in lesser known areas of manhattan. Sure the better known parts of manhattan can be fun the first few times you‚Äôre there, but after you‚Äôve been to places like the m&m store (which is admittedly fun, but overpriced), the Empire State Building, Rockefeller, and so on it kinda gets boring. 

Unfortunately I think now is a pretty bad time to be here since not much is open. The metropolitan museum is so much fun imo, but I‚Äôm not even sure if that‚Äôs open rn. Plus food prices have gone up since the pandemic, at least in the Bronx. Things were expensive before, but not this expensive. Also go to the highline if you haven‚Äôt, it just a nice 20 minute walk on top of a foot bridge with some nice greens (although not sure if it‚Äôs open rn), it‚Äôs in Chelsea a few blocks from the pier. 

Sorry you haven‚Äôt had a good time in New York City so far. I know that some places aren‚Äôt the best and it can be very expensive. Hopefully you enjoy the places that others are recommending. 

Also just a fair warning but there aren‚Äôt many trains in Queens so you‚Äôre probably gonna have to take buses or walk to get around. Be careful on the buses because I‚Äôve noticed bus drivers and passengers haven‚Äôt been wearing masks like they‚Äôre supposed to or they are wearing them in the wrong way.

Many local businesses don't bring competitive value to the market, they are what I call resalers. Resalers don't create value, they leach value. An example of a resaler is a middleman, someone that sells clothes or paint supplies manufactured from somewhere else. An example of a small business that isn't a resaler would be landscaping. Amazon is a resaler, and they only harm resalers. Producers and manufacturers and service providers will be fine. Restaurants that die out will be replaced with new restaurants.On the plus side, all of their employees will also be unemployed and have the possibility to start competing businesses to the ones they were employed at previous.

The governmental policy you are referring to was designed to stop nursing homes from throwing old people out, which is something they have done for years to anyone that required more than arbitrarily easy care. They claim they can handle XYZ medical tasks, and charge a premium dollar for those amenities. Then, when you actually need those amenities, they throw you out because you would cost them money.

This will give the housing markets in major cities a significant shake-up, but there will be a rebound on the other side. The major global trend in the last century has been *into* cities, not away from them. I would love if this pandemic were the catalyst to finally drive sustainable change towards remote working, but I'm doubtful. Many business owners, executives, and managers like to *see* their employees working hard. They cannot let go of that micromanagement. Many people in these roles are extroverts and indeed work harder and produce more in social conditions, so *of course* everyone else is exactly the same. The major hurdle is that working from home isn't an all-in deal. There are many gradations of suitability based on industry, product/service, role, personality, and company culture. Most workplaces will still need *some* degree of in-person presence. This requires smart, flexible arrangements, determined by smart, flexible managers. Said managers are not the rule. Further, it rules out moving cross-country away from one's job.

Ultimately I see a *slowing* of the urbanisation trend but not a reversal. I see more distributed populations as those who are given flexibility move out of the city and commit to longer commutes 1-2 times per week.

They're not interested in investing for profit, they just want to hold on to the property as an asset, so they jack up the prices so that no one will buy and so a lot of buildings go unutilized while the rest of the city as a whole is cramped for living space.

For example you want to go to target or something you gotta get to your car, spend 20 minutes getting out of downtown then like another 20 minutes driving in traffic to get there. Plus the store is always crazy busy so it takes 40 minutes to get the free things you need and get out. Then you gotta do the same thing on the way back. Hopefully you find a close parking space and didn't buy anything heavy or else you have to lug that a ways back to your place. So running that small errand takes three hours to do.

In a midsize city is like 10 minutes there, 20 minutes at the store back home in 10. Doesn't even take an hour and you probably have a close parking spot to.

Not really. We aren't as unique as we like to think. Schools and hospitals matter. Proximity to employment matters. Some jobs require face to face interaction or at least physical engagement with objects (think some trade jobs or manufacturing). There is a reason people flock to cities. Not to mention a lot of the rural places that *do* have some combination of the above would see land get bid up fast for eventual residential and commercial use. In the end it will be become *everything* you are running away from. But I think in the event there are people that opt out of city living there will be an equal amount that will want to take advantage of the lower prices and cost of living.

Quality Mexican food can‚Äôt be touched. And it always amazes me how you can only find it in border states (and in Mexico). Like, we also have some bomb-ass Korean restaurants in LA, that imo, compare easily to the homemade food you get in actual Korea. But Mexican food doesn‚Äôt have that stretch for some reason. It‚Äôs very local/regional specific and doesn‚Äôt travel. And once you know good Mexican food, eating it anywhere else is *not the same* , and it‚Äôs comical even. It‚Äôs a discussion I‚Äôve had many times with other California people. 

However, at the same time, it does make it a bit more special that you can *only* get it in border states and Mexico.

Like Texas is nice and the food is great but it‚Äôs pretty boring comparatively and the weather is awful. Do 105 summers sound fun? I heard it was hitting close to 110 in my home city this year. I don‚Äôt even need to say anything about Florida. It‚Äôs Florida. Everyone knows already. 

I‚Äôm not saying the person you replied to is conservative or anything like that but it‚Äôs certainly a common trend among conservatives to shit on big cities and liberal states. This sub also trends a bit more conservative. Bad news is once global warming has wrecked the world and automation has made most jobs obsolete they‚Äôll live in mega cities like everyone else. That‚Äôs off topic though. 

At the end of the day I‚Äôll take California‚Äôs relatively small issues. Look up California‚Äôs Over time laws or the fact that minimum wage is much higher. People might say ‚Äúoh but it‚Äôs too expensive to live in California even on that higher minimum wage!‚Äù Well no shit it‚Äôs hard to live anywhere on minimum wage, that‚Äôs kind of the issue. At least in CA you get more. There‚Äôs plenty of cheap ways to live here as well. After 9 years of living in LA and making good money the past few I would say over all it‚Äôs a pretty great place to live. 

Of course there are bad areas but honestly if you just do a few minutes of research you can avoid them entirely. It‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs even a problem specific to LA/California. People were still murdered in my small city in Texas in the 90s. There were bad parts of town and homeless people. In Florida a man was executed and lit on fire on the suburban path we took near our university. Another instance had multiple students mugged across a week by a guy who‚Äôd hit the students with his car and then rob them at knife point. He was only caught because he got so blatant he started doing it in the school parking lot. It took police weeks to do anything about it. 

All that being said. I actually don‚Äôt like NYC like the OP. I think his reasons are a bit wack but I myself can‚Äôt  stand how crowded it is. LA is at least spread out. It‚Äôs almost like a bunch of smaller cities contained in one. I‚Äôve lived on the west side and the trick is live near where you work. Longest I‚Äôve spent in traffic was 20 minutes.

Did the whole public transport thing and I loved it but it made things even slower though, and those trips even more infrequent. I think though that's why those trips become so infrequent is because of how much of a hassle they become in a big city. You can't just do things outside of your small defined area you have to plan trips and spend a significant time doing what are quick errands in a medium sized city and it's just a hassle to go outside of your bubble.

I also agree you end up getting stuck in a small bubble of a few blocks where you live and for me personally made the big city feel extra small and cramped. You got this giant city and stay within a few blocks 90% percent of the time minus the few times you feel like dealing with traffic and getting out of town. Since everything outside of your bubble becomes a hassle you just do things outside of your bubble way less than you would in a medium sized city since things take way longer and are less convenient.

Also I am with you suburbs are worse then living in the city, but for me personally living in a medium sized city is far more enjoyable then living in a large city just because you get 90% of the amenities and only 10% of the hassle. 

Really though it's all personal preference, and for me I just did not like being confined to a small bubble and dealing with the extra hassle. However people have different priorities and I can totally understand how people prioritize the benefits of a big city over a medium sized one.",t3_ja26if,1602571457.0

And small communities getting an influx of even 500 people is significant. Also a Silicon Valley employee would have certain things they still want in those areas. Expecting millions of people that live in urban areas to just move to rural areas and leave things as they are isn‚Äôt realistic at all.

Take ordering food to go as an example. In Chicago you order your food from the menu and being polite was small talking with the cashier/staff. In an NYC seli you can order whatever you want (give me 2 eggs scrambled on a toasted everything bagel with Bacon, onions, pickles and hot sauce) and they will whip it up fast. Chit chat is not polite because there are 20 people in line behind you that get held up while observations are made about how crazy the weather is.



I think NYC has a reputation for rudeness because people who come visit ""don't New York right."" Tourists are slow walkers that take up the sidewalk and stop frequently to look at stuff. A NYer is going to shove by you, annoyed, because the sidewalk got blocked. Imagine if your daily commute had 25% first time drivers.



Lastly, Chicago had a very pleasant feel, but felt A little colder when shit got real. NYC feels a bit gruffer day to day but I have seen real strangers helping people in need with genuine concern.

I pay 60 euros a month for my a sports subscription with which I can go to like 80% of fitness, climbing, dancing, boxing, swimming and much more and I can use it in different cities. You can get a cooled big bottle of beer for 1 euro at night stores everywhere and bars are also cheap (beer costs between 2,50 - 4 euros in most bars). It has a ton of parks where people often organize open air raves, just casually. If you've never been to one it's pretty insane.There are also really good house raves, or raves in abandoned factories as well as many artists squatting in some and having exhibitions. You can drink in parks and smoke weed at most beer gardens without people looking at you. In fact you can smoke weed mostly anywhere and nobody bats an eye. It was weird for me to go to a national park in Miami and have a ranger come up to us telling us we can't do that. Drug use is not really stigmatized here. I think the thing I like the most about it is that you're able to be yourself and nobody will bat an eye. You see pretty extravagant people here every single day. 

 We have hedonist clubs like Kitkat and many such parties where it's not just for the fetishist but anyone that kinda wants to dance and have fun in their skin suit (having sex there is no prerequisite). You can usually get decent meals at restaurants for less than 10 euros. 

I think the thing that surprised me the most was that NYC just felt dead at night compared to Berlin. There's always so much to do here on any given day 24/7, at least pre-covid.

I'd consider myself a centrist or maybe a moderate liberal. I guess it depends on who I'm talking about or what issue is being discussed, but politics are only a very minor part of my gripes with this state. First and foremost every city I've been in up and down this state is FILTHY. There is trash and grafitti and human waste of both kinds in unacceptable quantities. This is in large part due to the massive homeless population, which itself is something I'd just rather not be around. Another big problem is housing costs. Even with a salary exceeding six figures, buying a home in this state in a good neighborhood, away from the filth of the city centers, with a white picket fence and a green lawn is almost impossible. I also have never really liked the culture here, especially among people my own age. Don't care for unkempt Millennials with scraggly beards, facial piercings, and excessive ink. Don't care for people blasting rap music loud enough to shake windows at 11pm. Don't care for partying, drinking, drugs. I want someplace quiet, peaceful, and boring. As for your comment about the weather, I'd say California is too hot for me. The summers here are frequently in the low 100s and often enough reach 110. I'm probably going to move to either Washington, Oregon, or Idaho, where it's at the very least a little colder. I'm kind of surprised you mention that the people complaining about CA and NY don't know anything about the state when you clearly don't know what the weather is like here.

There are a lot of problems in states like California, and in big cities in general, but the way ‚Äúyour side‚Äù spins it they are hell holes no one wants to live in.

See Chicago for an example of this, meanwhile 80% of the people in this VERY thread are talking about how nice Chicago is. Fact is most people live in those cities because they like it. Just because you wouldn‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt. City life is rife with problems, like how expensive it can be and homelessness, etc, but let‚Äôs not pretend rural America and smaller cities don‚Äôt have massive problems of their own.

I live in a small city of about 100k people, Republican run from the mayor to 75% of the city council, and I see more homeless people now than I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. It IS a real problem but blaming it all on Democrats is so partisan it‚Äôs sickening.",t3_ja26if,1602619853.0

And first of all, I said transition. Not ban. Outright banning is obviously stupid, but a transition to clean energy has the majority of public support in the country, and in CO. Clean energy infrastructure would create many good jobs and in the long run would only improve your states air and water which benefits the people. And the wildlife which apparently you are very passionate about. 

I‚Äôm not forcing anything, you are the one that is telling people to ‚Äústay out of my state because your beliefs are invalid here‚Äù. Who‚Äôs the entitled asshole here? You think you have more right to live in your state than anyone else does? Spoiler alert: you don‚Äôt! It‚Äôs a free country. 

Yes, I know how conservation works. I actually work as a biologist and am not against hunting in anyway. But the simple facts, from wildlife biologists and ecologists, is that wolves have such a little impact on populations of elk/moose/deer that there is nothing to fear. As far as ranchers, coyotes kill more cattle than wolves do. Dogs kill more farm animals than wolves do for christ sakes! It‚Äôs all fear mongering. Ranchers should be reimbursed by the federal government from what little cattle predation by wolves there is, which I believe they are. Have you thought of the amount of eco-tourism brought about by wolves? Also let‚Äôs not ignore the fact that wolves are naturally dispersing into CO without them being a measure in the ballot. 

I‚Äôm not a self righteous fuck, I‚Äôm just sick of rural people in this country using shitty arguments to try and keep ‚Äúliberals‚Äù out of their state. I‚Äôm not forcing anything on anyone either, you are the one trying to make people conform to your ideas or go back to where they came from.

My dad is a geologist and has worked for the USGS in the past and has explained to me fracking takes place so far below the water table that the gas escaping doesn‚Äôt actually affect the water. What fracking ban proponents attribute to fracking affecting water is often actually methane pockets that a trapped closer to the water table that get released when people drill new water Wells. People attribute this to fracking when it‚Äôs literally impossible for natural gas to travel through that many miles of bedrock into the water table. It‚Äôs incorrect information that‚Äôs being passed off as fact. Even the former governor of Colorado who is a democrat but also a geologist was against fracking bans. 

Even a study done by Stanford for the California Council on Science & Technology concluded:

‚ÄúThe study found no releases of hazardous hydraulic fracturing chemicals to surface waters in California and no direct impacts to fish or wildlife.‚Äù (p. 35) Stanford University (2015):

I think we're saying slightly different things.  If you want to maximize your quality of life by mixing a rural cost of living with a telecommute salary then you simply can't go where everyone else is going or you will get bitten by the gentrification, exactly has you've been saying. What I'm saying is that, if you have a telecommute job, you are not bound to either the big cities or to the places that tech workers are ""flocking"" to. You're free. You can live anywhere.

I found this article interesting on the continuing study of it. 

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fracking-can-contaminate-drinking-water/

And also this article that shows there has been studies done that show fracking is causing negative effects to people living near fracking sites 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.livescience.com/amp/34464-what-is-fracking.html

A quote from this ‚Äú. In 2012, researchers from the Colorado School of Public Health released a study showing that air pollution caused by fracking could contribute to immediate and long-term health problems for people living near fracking sites. Research by over 150 studies suggests that chemicals released during natural gas extraction may harm human reproduction and development. A 2016 study also found that living near a fracking site might increase a person's risk of developing mild, moderate or severe asthma.‚Äù

And I found this SUPER interesting (probably because I grew up on the San Andreas fault line) also research done by a geologist in Colorado it looks like about how fracking is messing with seismic activity.

I also want them to do more research into the earthquake risk because to me that seems more promising. 

I just hate they use fracking is going to poison your water when the science doesnt support it.

That‚Äôs my biggest issue is not as many people are willing to take the time to understand why people do what they do. I‚Äôm glad you came into it with an open mind because understanding why the locals do things the way they do is important. 

I travel for work so I get to meet people all over and get many perspectives.

My clients in jersey use fuck as a comma, noun, adjective, verb and almost every sentence so that‚Äôs how I speak. In Oklahoma I try to watch my swearing because my clients are religious. 

To me I completely understand why Californians want what they do and Texans want what they do and would feel out of place telling each other that their way of doing things is wrong.

NYC's subway is fucking awful. And you'd only know this if you traveled elsewhere. We're just now rolling out contactless pay. The infrastructure is showing its age, and the fare continually increases with no improvements in service.

The only benefit that I can see is that it operates 24/7. A shock when you're going somewhere like DC and the Metro shuts down at 11.

I love my city and all, but riding on the E just now was like living in a shanty town. That route stays underground for the entirety of its route so right about now? Handfuls of homeless people in the cars. Full on carts covered in tarp and the stench... It's a fucking problem. These people need mental health facilities.

Housing is scam here also. People pay dearly for the ""privilege"" to live here and forget about my generation even managing something like home ownership if they're determined to be in close proximity to Bklyn or Manhattan. Unless you wanna live in a shoebox or get roommates up the ass to bring down the cost.

I'm not gonna say I agree with your take OP cause your sticking points are kinda dumb touristy nonsense. But as someone who lives here, I think these complaints mentioned hold weight.

3524,3524,bnmu4j,en82kz0,5,t3_bnmu4j,"I was onboard until you started talking about how the people who give it character can‚Äôt afford to live there. Nobody gives it character.

I lived there for two years between 2005-2007, and I only ever entertain the notion of a day-visit to see the Nintendo store with my kid. New York was one of the worst geographical experiences of my life.

San Francisco gets a bad rap for being dirty. New York City‚Äôs about four times filthier.

New York is the only place I‚Äôve ever been where inconveniences and backward approach is celebrated as character and charm.

In 2007, about 1 in 8 establishments accepted a credit card. Maybe this is more modernized now, but I doubt it.

Everything is overpriced and ridiculous, even in the far flung reaches of Brooklyn, where I lived (Bay Ridge).

I was trying to study media and video with some friends who had somewhat recently graduated form the NYFA and had decent positions in television and a steady stream of freelance work. While I was learning software and basic principles form them, I worked in retail. I worked at Target, Toys R Us, and Best Buy.

The Target where I worked was in Flatbush as part of some kind of outdoor mall thing they were building. It was completely disgusting. It was filled with roaches and rats, none of the employees ever did anything (except throw TVs and Microwaves off the top storage shelves, angry someone got corned and was forced to call upstairs for one), employees would drop food items in mystery goo puddles and just put them back on the storage shelves. I was made head of a department (a department that just rescanned everything in the backroom back into their locations for inventory, because people wouldn‚Äôt do it and everyone stole) my third week, because nobody else did anything but steal, break shit, and say constant racist things about the Jewish and Asian customers who would come in. I felt sorry for every customer I saw order Starbucks or Pizza Hut inside the store.

For the first three months I lived there, I wanted to burn my shoes at the end of the day, just from walking outside on the ground.

Everyone there acts like all the gross, inconvenience, and lack of up-to-date technology is cool. I expected New York to be at least as technologically sound as the Cleveland suburbs where I grew up, but it was about 15 years behind, and when you point it out, people accuse you of being soft (again, this was 2005-2007, maybe things have changed, but I doubt it). Therefore, nothing really ever gets fixed.

I‚Äôd actually argue, in terms of standards of living and modern life, if not for the hipsters, New York would probably still be stuck in the 80‚Äôs, rather than the 90‚Äôs like it was when I was there.

Went to New Orleans about 7 years ago, which is the opposite of NYC and it was immensely underwhelming. Most of the stores just close whenever, for whatever reason because people are lazy. The drinks are Manhattan prices. Bourbon street smells like actual shit. The locals pretty much dismiss you when they hear a northern accent. People tell you to stay out of certain neighborhoods, which keeps you in the touristy french quarter and the 24/7 amateur hour that is bourbon street. But hey, there's jazz music playing on every corner so...hope you like jazz?

To defend NYC:

There is something for literally everyone in the city. Easy to traverse either on food, public trans or the many readily available cabs/uber/lyfts. Manhattan pretty much has no ""dangerous"" part anymore. Maybe Washington Heights, but I walk around there as a white guy all the time and I've never had a problem. Brooklyn is a Hipster heaven but if you can get over it for a day, you might have some fun and most of the newer residents there are from all over the country and most of them are very friendly. 

>The NYC subway is creaky and busted and full of crazy drug addicts and nasty hood rats that just wanna fight.

Yeah, it's not the 70's anymore. Subways have their share of crazies but it is 1000% cleaner and safer than it was from 1970-1996. 2019 NYC is not the movie The Warriors.

I think living in areas of high population density has a pretty negative impact on people emotionally, leading them to be closed off, distant, and rude.  Nothing scientific, just my own observation.

Some falsehoods based on assumptions or limited interactions:

*""It‚Äôs cramped and smelly and filthy."" ‚Äî* some areas are, for sure, and there are urban planning problems related to all of that. But many neighborhoods are surprisingly spacious and cleaner than a lot of cities I've been to around the world. There are lots of parks and green areas, more than most other urban centers in America.

*""Everything is cheesy and ridiculously overpriced.""* ‚Äî sounds like Times Square and tourist locations in Manhattan. Yes I won't lie things are overpriced in a lot of places, but if you know where to go or avoid touristy areas, you can eat a sandwich for $4 or a $1 coffee or find a beer for $5. With regard to trendy food scenes, LA, SF, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, etc are no less expensive for these things, and I've been to all those places to compare. Actually in terms of what is ridiculously overpriced in NY, I'd pretty much say it's real estate, and even then it isn't as bad as SF these days.

*""The drinks are watery and everybody wants a fat tip just for showing up.""* ‚Äî Depends where you go. There are plenty of bars in the city that are divey, cheap, and will pour drinks that are stiff AF. If you're nice to your bartender they'll probably comp you a drink, it happens all the time.

*""The NYC subway is creaky and busted and full of crazy drug addicts and nasty hood rats that just wanna fight.""* ‚Äî MTA does have lots of problems and we love to complain about them, but it's the only major system in the world that runs 24/7/365 with as many lines as it has. Also it's gotten a lot cleaner over the years. Occasionally you will see drug addicts and people looking for a fight, but this is not everyday anymore, it's more rare than anything. I'd describe the subway today as full of depressed looking people staring into their phones above all else.

*""Brooklyn is full of insufferable wannabe artists that are posing on Instagram on their way to their pizza jobs.""* ‚Äî If anything is insufferable, it's this lame ass stereotype. Sure, those people exist, in areas that make up like 10% of Brooklyn. There are so many different types of people here and they don't represent this at all.

I do agree with the notion that the city has driven out a lot of the artists and people who made the city edgy and cool in the first place. It's getting overly gentrified, losing character to more and more high rise condos, whole foods, and apple stores, all of which look the same. It bums me out.

I don't know if I'll stay here forever as I have gotten tired of how expensive real estate is for the little amount of space I get... but I'll tell you why it's been worth it even still, and why I don't think of it as paying more for misery: the city is still vibrant and full of life, feels incredibly diverse, people have a really go-getter hard-work ethic mentality you don't see many other places in the US, there are so many opportunities here if you know how to seize them, night life is still by far the best in America (there's something for everyone, whether you like dance clubs, wine bars, or divey shit holes with pool tables, and everywhere is open way later than the rest of the country), there are so many interesting and open people here worth meeting with insane stories to tell, and I dunno, there is some sort of *je ne sais quoi* in the air, that in spite of all its recent overpriced real estate and homogenous gentrification, it feels like the kind of city where anything wild/interesting/weird/funny/exciting can happen at anytime, and something about that makes me feel alive every single day.",t3_bnmu4j,1557701698.0
3852,3852,bnmu4j,en9i7v7,1,t3_bnmu4j,"You know, as much as I enjoy going to NYC for strolls and what not, OP isn't wrong. NYC is fucking gross, overpriced, and frankly aggravating to get around. Port Authority is a literal SHIT HOLE and I loath every time I have to travel through it to either be bombarded by the smell of unwashed homeless people, old urine, or just a homeless person trying to hustle you for money.
 

Another issue caused by homeless people in midtown is the COMPLETE AND TOTAL LACK of public restrooms. I can't tell you the number of times I'm in Midtown (say going to Midtown Comics) and get the need to use a restroom only to find that you can't even walk into the numerous Mickey D's in the area and use their restroom because it's LOCKED and GUARDED. 


NYC subways are also straight garbage. Having been on the rail systems in Boston and Montreal (Especially Montreal) I can tell you that the MTA is DECADES behind where it should be in terms of innovation. Not only that but subways have become resting places for the homeless which causes ENTIRE train cars to sometimes be overtaken by just one homeless person camping there. 


I'll end this comment with some food for thought: Because of my proximity to WTC, I sometimes like to take the Path train over and walk around Battery Park and 1 WTC, nothing crazy, just take in the sights. There is a Burger King not far from the WTC train station (Oculus), however, unlike every other BK, this particular franchise doesn't sell ANY value menu items, AT ALL. And the prices they do charge for regular combos meal are at least $3-$6 more expensive than at any other BK. FOR THE SAME FUCKING WHOPPER AND FRIES.

3861,3861,bnmu4j,en9xybo,1,t3_bnmu4j,"Born and raised in NYC.  Remember when Times Square was almost Hell On Earth especially when you're a kid.  Midtown became more of a tourist spa during the economic boom of the Clinton years after decades of poverty, policy corruption, and rampant crime.  We went from Death Wish, Saturday Night Fever, and the Warriors (which was itself a cartoon) to Enchanted, Spider-Man, and the Avengers.   The NYC of Frank Serpico could never be mistaken for the Manhattan of Patrick Bateman and Chandler Bing.  Williamsburg and Astoria are unrecognizable from what they once were.  But is this a bad thing?  I think part of it is how old you are now and what your perspective is.  Cinema used to be exciting and take risks, but producing a movie these days costs so much that studios pump out remakes and sequels in the hopes of stemming their losses.  The great writers of the tabloids, the Breslins, the Hammils have given way to yelpers and YouTuber's who barely have a grasp of the English language.  Charismatic and colorful mayors who you may love to hate, the LaGuardias and the Koches, have given way to the bland and grey DiBlasios. From progressive powerhouses like Herman Badillo you end up with faux politicians like Carlos DangerWiener while corruption continues unabated in the state legislatures.  From the shining oratory of Mario Cuomo to the unremarkable blatherings of his son, Andrew, NYC has become a generic shell of what it used to be.  CBGB's is some kind of hipster clothing shop.

My girlfriend is from Norway so I go there every year. My mother used to live in Sweden so I've been there as well. I've also traveled a bit around the world from Mexico to Asia, different places for months at a time.

Yet everytime I land back in NYC and set foot outside on the busy manhattan streets I can't help but tell myself ""this is the best F\*CKING place in the world"". The energy just walking down the street is second to none, and there's always so much going on. And have you seen New York in the spring or the summer?! Everybody's outside having the time of their lives. You cannot be bored here.

Some people seem to miss the days when everybody was constantly dying in this town from disease and super-high violent crime.  I don't. Now my city is safe as hell, is beautiful and still full of energy as so much still happens here. New York simply has the most interesting group of people you can meet anywhere in the world, whether in the arts, or sciences, or technology, finance or business, and all within very close quarters. Everywhere else I go to seems bland to me, or stale. I hear Berlin has a lot happening, but from far away Berlin seems like a giant hipster trash-hole.

Yeah NYC is expensive, but you can always make it work. I used to be a delivery boy making $5.50 an hour living in a shitty hole in Harlem(minimum wage here is now $15/hr how crazy is that!). I also did private event catering, bartending all these lush events and into the private homes of millionaires/billionaires while having to go back to my shitty studio in Chelsea at the end of a gig. But even while I was dead broke I was always having a blast. Great parties, great events. Meeting the most beautiful girls from all around the world who constantly come here. The diversity here is second to none. I've worked alongside French actors, Bielorussian political asylum refugees, brazilian models, mexican immigrants, ex-football players from the midwest, ex-convicts. I've worked in service, retail, political non-profit sector, nightlife, entertainment (was on a tv show briefly), and now I work in tech making a good living. from the ages of 16 to 34 I can say I lived the equivalent of 5 lifetimes of somebody who lives out in...I dunno Portland. (worst place I've ever been to).

But yeah, the rents are insane, and the local taxes feel like unecessary salt on the wound. However for me personally it's pushed me to make more money and taking some risks. I don't regret it. New York is the best place on earth.",t3_bnmu4j,1557688023.0

Dude, if you've lived here most of your life, as you claim, then you have to realize that most of your claims are straight ridiculous.

> Most of the ‚Äúhistoric charm‚Äù are tenement buildings that used to be slums that got converted into hipster condos.

Sorry, I missed the memo that we turned Grand Central, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Farley Post Office, and all of our museums into ""hispter condos"".

> The drinks are watery and everybody wants a fat tip just for showing up.

Lolwut? Did you just characterize EVERY drink in the city as watered down? That's absolutely insane and something I know to be patently false from my many years of drinking here.

Fuck, NYC has possibly the best brewery scene outside of the Bay Area, and that begs to differ.

> Even Broadway sucks. You can see great shows anywhere in the world now.

You let me know when I can see the original cast of Hamilton one night and a small, avant-garde black box production the next in Billings, Montana and we'll talk. Yea, shows tour now, but not all do. Two of my favorite Broadway shows are All the Way and Network, both featuring Bryan Cranston, and neither of them touring (the former is an HBO show though). We also get access to shows sooner and have more general variety than your local theater does. This point is insane and dumb. Also, the general talent of a Broadway performer is higher than even touring casts.

> The NYC subway is creaky and busted and full of crazy drug addicts and nasty hood rats that just wanna fight. 

What? Did you ride on the BART and confuse it for the MTA? I've seen homeless folks, but never people actively doing drugs on the subway. I'm also not sure who these hood rats are, but I think we're just interpreting the same group of people differently...

> Also, everything is either busted or under construction.

More baseless, untargeted sweeping generalizations.

You have some points. It can be cramped, it smells in the summer, and there are rats. Yea, things can be pricey. But, in general, you've taken a few problems and blown them up to represent the city as a whole. It's also a really close drive to some amazing beaches and nature in NYS; everyone and their mother tours to NYC, so you never miss a show; NYC in the fall and winter is beautiful and amazing; the city is constantly alive and it's not hard to find someone to drink with until 2am on a Tuesday; there's an insane collection of fine art here that can be seen for reasonable prices (not DC cheap); you're right on the Northeast Corridor, so going to DC and Boston is a breeze; and so many more.

> Just some cities function better than others, and New York is not one of them.

And pray tell, which US city works better than NY? From what I've seen, every other city in the US I've been to is also cramped, ""smells bad"", and they all manage to have worse public transit and bars close earlier. I'm not sure how you're judging ""function"" here, but I call BS.

You may be an ""old insider NY'r"", but I'm from a small town and lived a good deal of my life in the suburbs before spending the last ~7 years in NY. I'll take NYC over the boring, traffic infested, insane humidity, and compartmentalized existence of the suburb any day.

We got sandwiches at Molinari‚Äôs in North Beach (little Italy) and hung out in Washington Park on a blanket in the sun surrounded by music, people, and pups.

Then we walked across Columbus St. and got a glass of wine and sat outside people watching on an outdoor patio listening to live music being played on the street. 

Then, we walked over to China Town and bought some exotic fruits and went tea tasting ($35 for two). Fireworks were going off. Asian people everywhere hustling and bustling in the seemingly endless markets filled with culturally authentic foods and trinkets. 

It was a fantastic and cheap Saturday that was super easy and relaxing. We took in tons of local culture and had we been more ambitious, we could have experienced more. 

Try doing that *anywhere* else in America. It‚Äôs almost impossible. THAT‚ÄôS why SF is so popular. I suppose if you just go to work and back to your expensive apartment, yeah it might seem over rated. 

I live in a house with 4 other roommates (as does my GF) but it‚Äôs just the way things are here now and we enjoy it. I love this city more than anyone I know. Is it changing? Of course. Is it hard to live here at times? Absolutely. Would I want to live anywhere else? Absolutely not.

I'm someone who grew up in LA, moved out, and probably will never move back. That said, you're dead wrong about going to the beach. I think this depends a lot on exactly what you do while you're there. Do you lie on a towel and read a book? If so, I can imagine that getting old pretty quick.

Is NYC a movie set where anyone can come and have a chance at making it into the big leagues? No, of course not. Are there tourist traps? Fuck yeah, every place has them, from bumfuck nowhere, Idaho to Times Square..

Welcome to every city ever.

> real New Yorkers who used to make New York edgy and full of character can‚Äôt afford to live in New York

gatekeeping bs. What the hell is a ""real New Yorker""? People who fit your stereotype?

> Everything is cheesy and ridiculously overpriced

Some places are, some places aren't.

> The drinks are watery and everybody wants a fat tip just for showing up

I don't know what this is. Is this a specific place? Every bar and restaurant in the city? Seems like OP went to a Hard Rock Cafe and is surprised they got an overpriced burger.

> Also, everything is either busted or under construction

Also welcome to every city ever. It's not like 80's NYC was a pristine model of efficiency.

> Even Broadway sucks. You can see great shows anywhere in the world now.

And? Hollywood sucks too. It always sucked. If you're expecting to walk around and be dazzled while Frank Sinatra plays in the background you're going to be disappointed. It's just a fucking few blocks in a city, calm down. I've gone to see a few shows and tickets were super affordable and the shows were fantastic. I just don't expect to get $30 Hamilton tickets and see Lin Manuel Miranda act before an audience of ""authentic New Yorkers"".

> The NYC subway is creaky and busted and full of crazy drug addicts and nasty hood rats that just wanna fight

Maybe in a few places, but I go around all of Manhattan and a few of the other boroughs fairly regularly and have never had problems on the subway besides a few smelly people and some people who talk too loudly. No one has ever asked to fight me.

> Also: actual rats.

Also, welcome to every city and basically every area where humans live and throw away food. Next you'll tell me there are roaches and ants!

> And Brooklyn is full of insufferable wannabe artists that are posing on Instagram on their way to their pizza jobs.

DAE hipstur millenealz are annoying? Jesus christ Brooklyn is full of normal people. Maybe there are a lot of artists because Pratt is there? Or because people wealthy enough to own galleries locate them there? If you don't like twenty year olds on their phones, you're going to have a rough rest of your life.

>  I knew New York in the 80's, 90's, 2000's and I know its latest Disneyfied version, which is duller and more of a big dirty mall than anything else

Better than being worried I'll get stabbed while I'm walking home. Don't go to Times Square, Broadway, Empire State Building, or the Chelsea Market and you'll be fine.

> why are they putting up with this shit, 

Because we have jobs located here? Because we have friends and family here? Because if you get your head out of your ass and realize every place has good and bad things about it, you'll find the food you like, the activities you like, and it's close enough to the mountains/beach that you can take a weekend off and do anything that the city doesn't have.

Some people feel more comfortable in a town of 30,000 in Wisconsin. Cool, great, I grew up in a town like that. Loved it. May move back some day. Right now I'm thoroughly enjoying NYC because I don't feel a compulsion to look down on everyone around me.",t3_bnmu4j,1557688890.0

The higher cost of living has nothing to do with minimum wage. COL is high because a lot of people living there are professionals making high salaries and can afford to pay more.

it was america, the giant great that you used to grow up looking up to back in the 80s and 90s as an outsider, this semi-mythological place where things worked and were going up and they had a standard and the all-mighty-dollar and all this unreachable things for us outsiders.

now you can clearly see a sadly giant part of america is a drug-adict homeless bagabond and the one thing time and time again you'll see in this docus is that the root of all problems is always the goverment either by making policies that  made people lose their houses and end up homeless or my being unwilling to make policies to be able to get back up or get any help at all and even worse by making policies to make the problems bigger, like how doing hard drugs in the streets and parks is not even a real crime and shoplifters get released 24 hours later only to go back to rob the same store over and over while the cops feel devoid of any power or authority, it trully seems like a silent exodus up there and damn, the US used to be a first world country on top, now it can get as low as some of the worst countries.",t3_bnmu4j,1557708741.0

I'm looking at a half dozen apartments from $1595 to $1675 for a 1BR no fee in sunnyside queens.  10 min from midtown on the 7 train.  I'm looking at 4-5 available.  Up the budget by another 100-200, and you have a lot of selection.

$127/mo gets you unlimited transportation in NYC, pretty much anyplace you actually want to go, midtown, chelsea, the village, meat packing, hells kitchen, astoria, LIC, williamsburg, bushwick... anywhere.  So you don't need a $450/mo car payment, $100/mo insurance and $200/mo gas.  So back out around $700 in vehicle expenses and it's equivalent to about a $1000 midwest rent.  But you make 50-100% more in NYC, so really NYC is not nearly as expensve as people like to cry about.

I don‚Äôt think you are understanding the concept of a classic liberal if you think I‚Äôm a big supporter of minimum wages.  I dislike government intervention into any individual‚Äôs private lives and businesses.  I view government as a necessary evil, but would like to see it restrained in scope and power, especially where it comes to interfering with individual liberty.

Judging by your attempts to put words in my mouth , I would suspect you‚Äôre of a more hardline thinker.

Specific to policies that cities under Democrat leadership have and that I feel are liable for the attitudinal differences, I would suggest that high taxes, heavy-handed business regulation, quirky local laws and regulations, etc have a tendency to drive people who don‚Äôt agree out.  Over years, this leads to a population of those who agree politically, and the poor / working-poor that for whatever reason are inclined to stay (low housing costs due to artificial price controls, social services, not knowing anything different, etc).

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have no issue with the cities governing themselves as they see fit, and if the city population votes for and supports these measures, who am I to complain?  I just dislike being in them, so I choose not to.

Are opioids. opiods only indicator for addiction rates? Or are they only relevant when comparing overdosagev rates. 

Opioid overdoses in other places are highly affected by the fact that pretty much every where EXCEPT California, Oregon, and Washington are inundated with powdered Afghan type heroin. Cali, Portland, and Seattle are pretty much universally supplied with Mexican tar type heroin... Very different animals. 

Powder heroin is commonly and easily mixed with fentanyl... Which is the cause of most fatal heroin overdoses in the Midwest and East.

Not so on the west coast. Very different animals. And also why opioid overdose had like to do with drug usage, or addiction rates, or how drug usage effects local society...

You have to be willing to compare reality. 

Yes. Most successful suicides are committed with firearms. Liberal cities and states have severely limited the rights to own firearms. Care to research the effects on attempted suicide rates to successful suicide rates? 

There is more to statistics than just picking and choosing data to extrapolate flawed hypotheses from...

 The premise of your argument is critically flawed. 

The reason I su the best countries are homogenous... Is because the countries that you liberals always cite as examples of counties that are doing it better than the US are all very racially homogenous...

Yes, there is a chance it can go to rats. I doubt it though... Ebola isn't even near NYC.

**Edit:** A lot of the reason why people are getting Ebola is because they eat infected bush meat. It's also not being identified in these developing countries due to cultural and infrastructure issues. You eat the potentially infected bush meat or you die of starvation. I can see why they're taking a chance.

A good example of a hemorrhagic disease being controlled well while it still being in the eco System is the Hendra virus in my home city of Brisbane, Australia. No one here is really worried about it, because we have good quarantine and identification methods. Hendra has many similarities to Ebola, including it's mortality rate. But we don't see a pandemic in Australia, because we dealt with it. We invested into vaccines. There was a case where someone may have been exposed to the virus, and they came in, got the vaccine just in case, and prevented a possible spread. 

It's an issue of infrastructure and how seriously people are bothering to take the virus. We've been onto hemorrhagic diseases for a while now here.

For example, phosphate transporter genes derived from marine phytoplankton have been found in marine viruses, supposedly giving the virus an evolutionary advantage by enabling infected cells to increase phosphate uptake, which is a crucial resource needed for viral replication.

Unfortunately, the bounty for a dead rat (or rather, its tail I believe) was more than the cost of raising a rat.

It led to people breeding rats. 
 
A bounty system to mobilize people to kill rats would probably not work for safety reasons and the difficulty of ensuring that people are actually reducing the rat population. You would get almost nothing for a single rat, and you would have to have a massive volume to get anything worth spending, and that would have to be less than the nearly negligible cost of raising that many rats. 

IE, a bounty system would not reduce the number of rats at all, so it is best to pay professionals for a job well done.

Most of NYC (not all) is built on rock, not fill.  There are sections of Manhattan that are filled in and can't have skyscrapers (I think), but the prevalence of towers shows the lack of landfill, doesn't it?

Finally, if NYC is mostly fill, why does it look essentially the same (in shape) in 1609?

Map:
 http://welikia.org/m-map.php

EDIT: on the above site you can see areas that were filled out, particularly near the water and on the east side above 14th (or 23rd?) and around the edge of Brooklyn.   When you slide back to 1609 they disappear, but other than the chunk on the east side most of that is just waterfront parks where there were once piers.   Nothing close to ""most"", not even ""a lot.""",t3_3pcuer,1445338837.0

I want you to have to take it out of the deep-freeze freezer, you‚Äôll actually have to put it in the microwave just to take it down a bit, just a couple of degrees, to where it‚Äôs still way too cold to touch, I still can‚Äôt lick it, I‚Äôd still get a major ice-burn on my tongue if I attempted premature contact.

And then I want the spoon to be warmed up, not in a microwave, obviously, you can‚Äôt put metal in the microwave. Maybe I could find some sort of a composite spoon? All right, give me a spoon made out of the same material they make hockey sticks and golf clubs. I want it to be light, like ultra lightweight, so now OK, you can go ahead and throw it in the microwave for a minute or two.

If you haven‚Äôt already, you should go ahead and buy two microwaves, because I don‚Äôt want to wait around while you‚Äôre messing with different power level settings for the ice cream and for the spoon. I want them both to be warming up at the same exact time.

All of my soda has to be ice cold too. Also, the carbonation has to be really powerful. But more importantly, really, really cold. But only slightly less important, the carbonation. Don‚Äôt talk to me about freezing points, I want a colder-than-ice Coca-Cola that somehow hasn‚Äôt turned into a block of ice. I‚Äôve seen it done before, it was science class in high school, or a science TV show that the science teacher showed us on one of those days where she didn‚Äôt feel like teaching, it was something about not disturbing the liquid, or putting something inside of it, and it‚Äôll stay liquid.

You know that sensation you get when you first take a sip of a really ice cold drink? Like you can feel it working its way down your esophagus? I want that with every sip, not just the first. And I don‚Äôt want to feel it just in my esophagus, I want to feel it all the way down, snaking its way through my intestines, that refreshing feeling chilling a path throughout my whole digestive system.

My soup also has to be really cold. I don‚Äôt care what time of year you‚Äôre supposed to traditionally eat gazpacho, I‚Äôd like it in January, February, if there‚Äôs an unseasonably cold stretch through March or April, I‚Äôm going to order gazpacho then also, along with other summertime soups, watermelon bisque ‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt think of any other cold soups, but I know they‚Äôre out there, and again, ice cold, I want you to serve me a whole tube of Sensodyne as an appetizer, something to really numb up my gums, I want to hold a big mouthful and really let my whole head cool off.

Iced coffee, iced tea, ice, ice cold. And don‚Äôt bother with the regular ice cubes. I want ice cubes made out of iced coffee and iced tea. It has to be cold brewed, by the way. I don‚Äôt want anything that‚Äôs ever been heated up. I mean, yes, to some extent, I‚Äôm always going to have to acknowledge the fact that the earth was formed out of a ball of cooling molten rock, but that‚Äôs just it, it‚Äôs cooling, it‚Äôs getting there.

My favorite planet is Pluto. My favorite sport is ice hockey. If I got to choose a superpower, it would definitely be ice powers. Then I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about talking about any of this nonsense. Give me a hot soup, go ahead, I‚Äôll ice you dead in your tracks, that hot soup‚Äôs never going to make it over to my table. And then next idiot server who even thinks about sending over another bowl, he‚Äôs going to think again. He‚Äôs going to bring me the coldest one they‚Äôve got. And then ‚Äì zap! ‚Äì ice powers to make it even colder, and I‚Äôll be able to take it, no frost-burn, no Sensodyne, just straight up cold, colder than all of the Coors Light in the Rockies.

Because seriously, I can‚Äôt emphasize enough, I really like my stuff cold. Make sure you tell the chef, because I‚Äôve got a thermometer right here. I‚Äôm going to use it, and I‚Äôm going to send it back. It‚Äôs all just a matter of how many times I‚Äôm going to send it back. Got it?",t3_1unbod,1389141094.0

Three,  I had a pet rat for a while I loved unconditionally and am considering getting another pair, but having to put my last rat down deters me a bit.

But I think the difficulty of this fight would be that both could hunker down in places that would be difficult for the other to attack.  The sewer would be near impossible for the pigeons to attack, meanwhile the top of a building, while not impossible would limit the rats significantly and play to the capabilities and numerical advantage of the pigeons.  Pigeons win, but only 51/100 times.

R2: 1 v. 1, rat beats bird.  Horde v. horde, birds give more options.  This is tough, were it me, I'd use the pigeons to carry rats and drop them on some environmental hazard that will kill them, but can one pigeon carry one rat?  I don't think so.  Giving the birds weapons also gives more options than giving the rats weapons.  Pigeons win 67/100 times.

R3: Rats all the way.  This battle plays to their strengths and against the pigeons' strengths.  There's cover, there's an enclosed combat area, the rats are vicious when they get to their target, and the numerical advantage of the pigeons won't make up the greater ferocity of the Rats.

He can probably amass a blackmail pile sufficient to control every city politician in NYC within a month. After that, a city sanitation program that ruthlessly culls pigeons will dramatically curtail pigeon-lord's troops.

Even the number difference doesn't make up for the fact that hollow bones on the pigeon mean that pigeons are too fragile win against a rat, even in greater numbers. You could look up videos of rats taking down pigeons, and Tierzoo has a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0KOEd34Mb8&t=627s) on the city meta that ranks pigeons in D Tier and Rats in S Tier.

R1 - The pigeon has that best chance in this round due to pigeons being great scouts, as other people have pointed out. However, once the pigeon guy finds rat guy, then what? How does he win in a straight up fight when pigeons are like flying paper mache bobble heads? Not to mention that rat guy's best chance is to just wait things out in the sewers, a place where a pigeon's flight is completely neutralized. Yeah, pigeon guy can potentially fly, but you've gotta land sometime. And rat guy will be there.

R2 - Rats win even easier. Imagine the first seen of IT where Pennywise drags the little kid into the sewer to be devoured. Now make him a rat. 

R3 - Rats take it again. Pigeon guy MIGHT have a chance if he uses the pigeons in a bomber style to drop rocks on rats, but I don't see that being effective when rats can just burrow underground. Even Central Park has sewers.

8644,8644,hzyt71,fzm5wxx,6,t3_hzyt71,"Last time we had a rat vs pigeon debate I found a video on youtube of a rat clearly wrecking a pigeon buuuut... rats are outnumbered here. Pigeons can't really do much damage to a rat, but rats straight up cant kill pigeons in most of their normal spots. Neither animal gets wiped out in round 2. Rats might win round 3 because while pigeons are bigger than rats I don't think pigeons have enough power to actually score kills on a rat. I actually think rats are harsher villains because they can infest homes and can potentially kill high ranking officials. Pigeons can do damage but only until you know they're a problem.. then you can just stay outside. 

Round 1 is the most interesting one because thats actually almost entirely up to how smart the rat king and pigeon king are. How would they ever even find the person behind the other army? Its not like they have to do some big spell or wave their arms around. Even if you had scouts everywhere, you wouldn't even know what to look for. However, if something comes up in their personal life and they use rat/pigeon powers to kill/harm someone, they could potentially track down their enemy using that. But then they'd have to find a way to track the other one down without outting themselves first. They also could both just go to Long Island and be out of each other's kill ranges. When it comes down to a 1v1, I think pigeon person wins just because it sounds like pigeons have an easier time blitzing a grown human than rats do, and while pigeons kill slower than rats there's potential that someone getting mauled by pigeons would no longer be able to control his rats... although again you can do a decent job defending against both just by sitting in your car, and anyone who brings a gun to that fight is probably winning quicker anyway. Also pigeons have a slight advantage in terms of logistics - pigeon person can summon his whole army in like 30 minutes, rat person has to wait for his army to cross subway lines and straight up might not be able to get his army into staten island at all",t3_hzyt71,1596026148.0

Rats can cause more damage, and are tougher to kill plus have a much faster respawn. 

If RatMan is smart, he'd hole up somewhere and wait for BirdMan to look for him. Then the rats pounce and boom, he's chewed to bits. Other, more aggressive tactics would be fine, as he could duck inside at the sight of any pigeon swarms and then wait for BirdMan to arrive. Then he has to deal with swarms of rats whilst inside where his birds will be unable to help.

Round 2- rats can reproduce faster than pigeons but are more limited in where they can hide. Also other humans are intent on wiping out rats. Overall, it'd say this is likely a stalemate.

Round 3- I'd say rats will chew through a human faster than pigeons could peck someone to death, unless you Americans have any secret pigeons we haven't been taught about.

8659,8659,hzyt71,fzo55y3,3,t3_hzyt71,"R1 - Rat man. Rats are, by and large, able to get into way more places than pigeons can, whereas pigeons have limits to where they can break into because they lack the rats' insane rteeth and hand-like paws (there's a reason most people don't have to worry about pigeons chilling in their walls). If Rat Man shelters in the right place, like some basement, the pigeons are basically SOL and it would take Pigeon Man himself wading up to that fortress of rodents to break in himself. So long as Rat Man stays indoors, maintains a low profile, and makes sure to stay well away from windows then he is basically safe in perpetuity, while Pigeon Man can't hole up anywhere long because the rats will find him and eventually become so concentrated they'll kill him (as far as the 2-1 advantage goes, rats are by themselves bigger and stronger than pigeons are, and so while a pigeon could harry a rat, if the rat gets a hold of one it's game over).

R2 - Rat Man. Rat nests are, by and large, less exposed to pigeons than pigeon nests are to rats. Add the fact that I think the rat K/D would probably be somewhere in the neighborhood to 3-4 pigeons per rat killed, while it would be bloody I just don't think that the pigeons can manage forever. It would take years, decades maybe, but a grounded pigeon is vulnerable to rats, while a rat is only really in danger of multiple pigeons. The rats can sleep in safety, hide in places pigeons don't typically look, and when the pigeons need food, the rats will be in prime position to launch hit and run attacks. If a rat gets caught by a flock of pigeons it'll be a mess, sure, but rats are adapted to staying well out of sight, while pigeons aren't necessarily the same way. When they need to sleep, they'll need to trust whatever ledge or nest they're in will be secure, but I've seen rats walk tightropes already, those fuckers are mobile, so no pigeon is safe all the time.

R3 - Pigeon Man. A pitched battle is tough, and while I still want to favor the rats I think the pigeons' sheer numbers and mobility will be enough to carry the day, though I think there will be more pigeons dead than rats. The pigeons would be able to fly down in tandem, carry away a rat, and drop it. If the rats catch the pigeons then that's game over, sure, but the sheer volume of pigeons as opposed to rats I think makes this way more fair to the pigeons.

BONUS - Rat Man. Pigeons will swoop people, causing several initial car wrecks and injuries. First responders are dive bombed and attacked with such intensity that some of those injured are left for themselves. Anyone who can shelter inside does so, and it will be only in very few buildings that pigeons would be able to enter in numbers great enough to cause serious damage. Some apartments are broken into by pigeons flying in through open windows or simply kamikazing themselves through the glass, but those would be relatively few and far between. That kind of sustained assault wouldn't be possible forever, especially when SWAT teams and the National Guard are called up as the city is immediately placed under a state of emergency. 

Meanwhile, with everyone trapped inside, the rats just chew a few wires and whoosh, hundreds of building fires spread throughout the city, with first responders having to brave flocks of thousands of birds to even get to where the fires are. EMTs and fire fighters need escorts to protect them from the pigeons, but hundreds if not thousands die from fires spread throughout the city. Some blocks might even be burnt to the ground, as the sheer volume of calamities forces authorities to weigh what they can feasibly save.

When fires are impossible or improbable for the rats, they simply ruin the food in most peoples' pantries, able to attack anything short of canned or jarred foods. Tens of thousands of pounds of food are suddenly inedible. While this may not necessarily be an issue to homeowners, who might have more canned or jarred food rats can't realistically get to, for the hundreds or thousands who were suddenly stranded in centers which might only have pantry goods, if they have food at all, the fear of starvation suddenly becomes a very real issue. Government responses are likely able to save thousands, and this whole terror would probably be settled well before mass starvation becomes a concern, the very old, very young, and already malnourished starve. 

In hospitals, all manner of life-saving equipment is made inoperable through rats chewing through wires. Life support machines and ventilators, especially, are targeted. PPE in hospitals, such as masks, scrubs, and gowns, are chewed to ribbons, meaning viral transmission stemming from hospitals suddenly becomes a massive concern. Those who would otherwise have been able to be saved die, and those who otherwise would not have gotten sick do. 

More direct attacks against people by rats, while rare, do happen, primarily against those who shelter from the pigeons in the subways. Dozens if not hundreds of people are devoured by a tide of hungry rats below the city, likely not even able to escape to the streets as most subways will likely have been gated shut to prevent the pigeons from getting down. However, some isolated buildings, primarily those for vulnerable communities such as the mentally infirm or the very old, are also met with attacks, some of which are successful and some of which are not.

The situation is eventually resolved after maybe a week or two of anarchy and chaos. Some isolated incidents of gun or weapon wielding civilians running into the street are recorded and go viral as they are swallowed by flocks of pigeons or swarms of rats, but those are hardly the rule. During that time, thousands have died, but perhaps tens of thousands more will die from the complete mauling of the New York medical system. The National Guard and SWAT will also only be able to stop the worst of this, killing the vast majority of both animals' populations and devastating the ecosystem of the city at large. Some of the rare (but still present) larger animals, such as coyotes, become more aggressive, killing house pets and attacking people with alarming frequency as they are deprived of some of their greatest food sources, and are likewise killed in large numbers. Similar mass killings of pigeons and rats can be seen across the world, and some pet owners will be crushed when legislation is passed banning the ownership of either animal in some cities, states, or countries. This event will have thousands of books, mini-series, and movies made about it in the following century.

TLDR; The pigeons cause a heap of initial panic and are able to keep the city shut down for days if not weeks, but the rats cause the real damage, primarily through infrastructural sabotage.",t3_hzyt71,1596062877.0
8660,8660,hzyt71,fzoc8l5,3,t3_hzyt71,"As a New Yorker who lives in The Bronx I'd like to chip in my two cents.  


Round 1: Rat person just has to chill in a basement with no windows (plenty of those around). Pigeons would have a hard time getting in. Rats on the other hand can make their way through anything through small gaps and are excellent in climbing navigating tight passage ways. Only way I see pigeon boy successfully evading the rats is by being in an airship or boat and even then rats have been known to occupy those vehicles. I'd give it to rat boy 7/10  


Round 2: Hmm.. Depends. I can see the pigeons just circling over heads picking off rats one by one. I can also see rats sneak attacking tired pigeons that come to land for a break or food/water. It'll be a battle of attrition. pigeons out number rats two to one but I think the rats are more skilled at surviving winter because they have more places to hide such as subways, buildings, etc. If it drags on until winter rat boy barely manages a win 5.5/10 if not I give it to pigeon boy 7/10  


Round 3: Depends on who can blitzkrieg fast enough. To be honest I can't see a flock of pigeons causing enough bodily harm to kill a human faster than a swarm of rats. There is a lake in central park that pigeon boy can chill in the center of but iirc rats know how to swim. I'd give this to rat boy 6/10  


Bonus: It's a draw. Both can cause millions of deaths easily. For rats you can take the current strain of Covid-19 and modify it so that it becomes more deadly and  transmittable through rat bites, blood, & feces. It will be known as the Black Death 2.0. For pigeons you can do the same such as the bird flu or avian influenza. Let's be a bit more creative though. You can strap anthrax or nerve gas to the pigeons making a wave kamikaze birds who fly through cities killing millions.

Rat Man can hide deep underground somewhere extremely hard for pigeon access, while the rats can get into nearly anything and will cover more ground working their way up from underground. Pigeon Person's pigeons are unlikely to locate Rat Man and unless Pigeon Person creates an impenetrable barrier around himself to protect himself from the millions of rats coming his way once he's promptly found and creates a scenario where Rat Man is lured out to try and kill Pigeon Person himself, and it becomes a game of Rat Man using his information of Pigeon Person's location to manipulate a situation where Pigeon Person's barrier is disrupted without being detected. It will be hard to avoid detection in this unlikely scenario, in which case the pigeons will peck him to the bone while his surely fierce squad of rats won't be able to save a singular human from an unrelenting aerial assault. Rat Man 8/10

Round 2: Assuming the stand users can only control the animals to the natural extent of their capabilities, this battle comes down to siege warfare. While the rat certainly has a fierce bite and could disable a pigeon easily should they come to blows, the pigeons flying ability prevents the rat from engaging on its own terms. With this advantage, Pigeon Man forces a stalemate. With flight and a 2:1 numbers advantage, the pigeons can easily surveil the largest food sources of the rats; garbage around the city. Most of which is above ground so the rats must expose themselves to eat. The Pigeons have an easier time getting food from natural sources that are more easily available to them. It all comes down to whether Pigeon Man can use his numbers and flight advantage to bully the rats away from their food. Pigeon Man utilizes his flight and numbers advantage to enact a 3:1 engagement strategy against any rats seen trying to get food. But the rat is fierce indeed, and takes down at least one pigeon with it. As the numbers dwindle at an almost even pace, the ratio at which the pigeons outnumber the rats increases. A certain point is reached where the pigeons can no longer effectively surveil enough food sources that the rats can scurry between. This forces the pigeons to chase the rats into their natural environments of claustrophobic spaces, where the rat has a massive advantage, to try and finish them off. Rat Man 6/10

R3: Assumes battle is decided when either stand user dies. Rat Man consolidates all his rats together to form a menacing mass of two million rats with him at the center and moves forward. The mass is spread thinly enough so that he isn't crushed under the weight. Pigeon Person sends forth his terrifying fleet of pigeons and before long they're above the rat mass. Before they knew what was happening, the Rat Man and his army were greeted with bird droppings that came with the thunderous sound of a heavy rain. However, being NYC rats, it had little to no effect considering they're well acclimated to being covered in shit and piss. Pigeon Person knew this would be the case but he figured, ""*it'd be funny*"". It certainly pissed off Rat Man. Now covered in fecal matter, the Rat Mass presses on towards its target. The maelstrom of pigeons and rats around Rat Man measures several dozen meters, but he presses on with every rat focused on defending the mass.

8677,8677,hzyt71,fzmzeh4,2,t3_hzyt71,"R1: team rat. All the rat master has to do is lock himself inside. The pigeons have no real capacity to get inside. I know there‚Äôs 4 million of them, but only so many can surround a building, shed, whatever at one time, and that number isn‚Äôt enough to do damage/ break in to a structure. Not before the rats can break into something equivalent. I used to work in a hardware store with constant rat problems. They‚Äôd chew through the concrete and the brickwork. They are getting in long before pigeons are. 

R2: team rat again. Pigeons outnumber the rats 2-1. They have a huge advantage in mobility. However there‚Äôs really nothing they can do with it. They don‚Äôt have talons, their beaks aren‚Äôt powerful (and if they‚Äôre close enough to the rats to peck, they‚Äôre probably already being killed by the rat. Even 2-1 they can‚Äôt lift the rats (average NYC rat is 16 inches long and 454g Some get up to 20 inches and 900g. Rock pigeons weigh 360g) They can‚Äôt even use their speed and mobility to dive bomb. They‚Äôre not built fo it. Their bones are brittle and they‚Äôd break before the rats using that strategy. I don‚Äôt even think they could lift anything heavy enough to hurt the rats when dropped. Their beaks and feet aren‚Äôt equipped to lift, and they almost definitely don‚Äôt have the accuracy to land kill shots regardless. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a meaningful thing they can do to the rats but if they get close the rats can certainly inflict lethal damage.

R3: the same for similar reasons. I do believe a person could fight off 4 million pigeons than they could fight off 2 million rats. Rats are not nice people. 

R4: again, rats can chew through concrete, power lines whatever they want really. In a combined, coordinated effort they‚Äôd be a borderline WMD.

This could manifest in two primary ways, they could bootstrap their own intelligence by forming a hive mind, composed of both their own intelligence and a percentage of cognitive capacity added for each rat/pigeon added to their swarm.  Or each master could give their swarm general goals they know fit their swarm's natural skills and problem solving set, letting them find unexpected solutions on their own.  Or their powers could synergize between these two options.

I think the pigeons would do better than expected.  Birds are generally fairly smart, and are probably more likely to think three-dimensionally, rather than being hidebound to thinking from an earthbound perspective.  But rats... rats are *canny*.

8706,8706,hzyt71,fzpb4qq,2,t3_hzyt71,"Round 1: The pigeon man wins, he can cover more ground and get somewhere higher up, rats can't unlock a door and can only really search ground level, pigeons can be anywhere, now, I have two scenarios, 1) they've both had their respective powers for a few years and knew this day would come, Pigeon man builds a harness (supposedly it takes about a thousand pigeons to lift an average person), he also makes a series of harnesses for his pigeons and uses them to fly around, rat-man makes a small fortified platform to ride his rats like a wave, and an arm-mounted rat-a-pult for the hell of it. Pigeon man uses his superior mobility and surveillance to locate and take out Rat-man, Rat-man uses the rat-a-pult to take out a few pigeons and lower the pigeon-man's mobility but is ultimately overwhelmed in the mass descent. 2) they both get their powers and mission that day, and Pigeon man still has the advantage and wins.

&#x200B;

Round 2: same scenarios. I think it's be close, in both 1) Rat-man uses his rat-a-tat-tat-a-pult (I'm not sorry) to launch rats at pigeons, the rats latch onto the pigeons and claw at them until they fall into the churning ocean. As the pigeons dive down in clouds the rats engulf them, but I think in the end, the pigeons would overwhelm them with numbers. Scenario 2) is the same thing but less interesting.

&#x200B;

Round 3: Scenario one: Pigeon-man stood surrounded by his cooing army, cables ran from his torso to two-thousand pigeons around him, a million more hiding in the trees and on surrounding buildings, the rat-man stood at the far end of central Park, a churning ocean of squeaking rodents around him, he sat in his wooden box, a series of small windows around him, he checked the device on his arm and ordered a few rats to climb inside his small defense. The clock struck noon and the armies advanced, a torrent of flapping wings erupted into the sky, the pigeon-man's cables tightened and his feet lifted off the round, the sea of rats advanced, seamlessly pouring around trees as if they were liquid. A cloud of pigeons dived down on the Rat-man's palanquin, Rat-man grabbed a rat and loaded it in his wrist-mounted device, then pulled back on the string, then he fired the rat-a-pult, the rodent twisted in mid-air and sunk its claws and teeth into the avian, dragging it to the ground and ending it, he fired more out the small windows, the rats dragged the pigeons down into the ever-shifting mass. Platoons of Pigeons descended into the fray, pecking and clawing at the rodents, some were dragged down, others pulled rats into the air and dropped them back, cracking grotesquely against other rats, animals on both sides were left wounded and bleeding. While some flocks kept clumps of rats busy others would skim the surface and snatch rats up, dropping them on fence spikes and pavement, though not without wounds of their own. The Pigeon-man watched from above, he saw through the eyes of his avian armada, he was concerned with the loss in number, it was time to take personal action, he gathered all of his pigeons into one giant flock, he positioned himself above Rat-man's transport, the Rat-man also made a change in tactic, his rats climbed on top of themselves, rising up in towers, leaping up and latching onto the avians. The Fleet descended, blocking out the sun, the Pigeon man dropped fast, he crashed through the wooden roof of the vehicle and grabbed the rat-man as the two armies collided like the jaws of a colossal beast, the two rose above the clouds, positioned over the open roads, nothing to cushion the blow, the pigeons surrounded the battlefield to trap the rats, only small amounts able to slip through, the Pigeon-man let go and the rat-man plummeted, he fired off one more rodent from his rat-a-pult, it raked it's claws against the pigeon-man's cheek before it too fell from the sky, he heard the sickening crack of a man against the sidewalk and watched through his feathered friends as the rats forgot their orders and dispersed, fanning out through the city streets, crawling into sewers and trash cans, he relinquished control of his pigeons as he flew over to his apartment, he watched the cloud of pigeons spread over the city, spreading thinner and thinner until it was a normal-looking sky, the streets littered with animal carcasses, the Rat-man's transport sat dormant in the park, broken and abandoned, briefly used as a homeless man's shelter until it was broken up and sold, it was a strange day, a very, very strange day.

&#x200B;

Round Three: Scenario two: same deal, less interesting, Pigeon-man finds Rat-man's hideout simply because he can escape the rats.

&#x200B;

Bonus: I think this is easily the closest, the rats have the fear advantage, I'd imagine more people are scared of rats than by pigeons, and seeing an ocean of rats pouring through the streets. But there are more pigeons, they can blot out the sun and smash high windows, people below hear glass breaking and scatter as it hits the sidewalk, then the birds descend and attack like Alfred Hitchcock. If they were to use explosives the birds can get up higher and shower passerby with debris, though the rats could sneak into crowded spaces. I think the rats take it if they're using explosives, pigeons if it's just plain animals.",t3_hzyt71,1596088218.0

**R1**: The Hunt is probably most affected by weapon usage. I think Birdman could fly himself up and snipe Rat King from a good vantage point. No weapons I think Rat King has advantage cause he could probably easily track and spread a disease to Birdman.

**R2**: I think Rat King wins this one no matter what. Rats reproduce too quickly to control. They can probably win a war of attrition, and simply eat any eggs the birds try and lay.

**R3**: If they charge at each other Anchorman style, it would be kinda weapon dependent also. With weapons, Birds have the added advantage of mobility and being able to drop like bombs and nets and such on the rats. No weapon means the birds have to drop down to the rat levels for melee. The rats can ball up and form armors and golems and such a little more easily.

To me, those ones seem primarily about disabling the man controlling the army of vermin -- incapacitate him, and he can no longer control his animals.

Pigeons are faster than rats, so I could see them winning R3 quite easily by just rushing Ratman before his rodent army reaches Pigeonman. Even if they're weak individually, 4 million birds can confuse Ratman into losing control within seconds, and crush/shred him in minutes.

In R1, a smart Ratman could counter the birds' speed advantage by hiding indoors until his swarm can reach Pigeonman. But Pigeonman could do the same, turning the fight into a protracted espionage situation. To me, the winning strategy for both men would be dispersing their swarm to track their opponent, and then either swarming him, or -- if it's allowed -- poisoning might be highly effective. Rats have the advantage in stealth, so I'd give this one to Ratman if he plays his cards well. But it'd really be a tossup based on who is found first, far from a guaranteed win.

And for the bonus round, I love the picture, but don't think it's that clear-cut: birds can carry very little, and detecting and shooting down a pigeon is easy. Plus, that sounds like a suicide mission; you'd run out of pigeons. I'd say that rats armed with poison/disease would be far deadlier -- nobody, indoors or outdoors, would be safe from a rat scurrying up and scratching them.

With the ability to now feed a population and an ability to penetrate the entire city ad finitum, you could instruct a portion of your tiny slaves to pilfer tiny amounts of copper from the insides of wall cavities to sell for more pigeon-killing reserves.

While digging through the walls and inner workings of one of the most influential cities in the world, you discover that you have created one of the most extensive surveillance and information gathering networks to have ever existed. This puts China to shame. Now the billions of tiny rat paws aren't dealing in copper wire and lost coins, they're carefully listening and transcribing the behind-closed doors trade secrets, the stock tips, the crypto wallet passwords, even the voting intentions of every person in New York.

> They can sense through their animals senses. They have the mental acuity  and multi-tasking ability to accurately control themselves and all of  their animals at once without being overwhelmed. The animals can be made  to leave the city, but then control is broken. 

This does not specifically deny that the two parahumans in question are able to let animal autonomy  enter into how they control their animals.  It all depends on what is meant by ""control themselves and all of their animals at once without being overwhelmed.""  I say this could very well include a subset of ""control"" where the parahuman gives broad objectives, and lets the animals, at some level, figure shit out on their own.  You appear to disagree.  That's fine.  I say it's simply *unclear*, given the prompt, if this is, or is not possible.  Without W.o.G. from the person who started the prompt, we're simply at an impasse.

However the example given where Skitter controls her bugs, would support my argument.  Skitter was perturbed and annoyed that she had to  control every motion of Atlas, rather than setting a goal for him, and letting its instincts autopilot some of it's behaviors.  Letting the instinctual behaviors of her insects contribute to her control was a part of Skitter's power.  Given that her character's power and this prompt's powers are so similar, I thought it reasonable that they might further resemble each other in ways not explicitly stated.

If the rats and pigeons just blindly started killing until the lease of the other team died, pest control would be called and the rat and pigeons population would die, so surveillance is the only option. The pigeon king could use pigeons to take over the top floor of a tall building and have pigeons bring food, but the rats could storm the building and if that doesn‚Äôt work they could keep suicide bombing the top floors until the pigeon king was forced to flee. The pigeon king could use pigeons to lift him up and Carry him away, but even if the pigeon swarm could carry their ruler to safety, the rats could use guns and small projectiles to attack, even slingshotting themselves at the pigeon swarm. In order to truly be safe, the pigeon king would need to flee the city as soon as he learned of the game, then have the pigeons prevent any resources or people from exiting or entering New York, then picking off the inhabitants of New York one by one until the rat king is no more.

Let's try this from a different angle.

Two ideas come to me.  

Firstly, people will always be lazy, if given the chance.  If controlling every aspect of your millions - strong swarm of rats/pigeons is in any way more difficult than kinda-controlling your swarm, people are gonna be inclined to be lazy, and take the easier option, at least sometimes.  Especially if loosely setting goals, and letting instinct of rats/pigeons take the fore still lets you achieve your goal.  Provided that doing so will not sacrifice any quality of service provided by the swarm.  (Also, people gotta sleep.  What happens to the swarms when their masters are drowsy, sick, or unconscious?  Having the ability to set and forget tasks while the Master is indisposed would be a damn useful side-power to have, yes?)

Secondly, imagine what a human controlled swarm might look like.  Unnatural.  Eerily coordinated.  But, perhaps, on a deeper level, predictable as well.  Two adversaries, observing each others swarms, and fighting against the other's swarm might learn things about their counterpart.  Like two fencers sparring, they might learn how the other likes to fight.  Their strategies, their style of moving, their tics.  One might gain an advantage by taking exploiting the habits of one's enemy.   One might also make it more difficult to do so by introducing a bit of randomness to the fight.  I'm imagining a fencer hiring bystanders to jump out of hiding and toss things at their opponent once in a while.  Kick at them.  Distract them.  Make it more difficult to predict the flow of the fight.

Having perfect control over your swarm is an incredible power, but might be a weakness, if it leads to your swarm possessing aspects of behavior that are predictable.

A harvest mouse, common rural mouse for US is ~8.2g (0.3oz).

A full size adult urban mouse in the US is up to 19g (0.67oz).

A New York rat is 907g (32oz).



The size difference is much larger than people are giving it credit. So I really don't think the rat would be fine. Might not be instant death for all the rats but they would likely die of their injury soon after.

Rats have highly infectious bites due to their small needle like teeth which push bacteria deep into a wound. They are carriers of a wide variety of transmisable diseases.

Pasteurella multocida which can be carried by rats can cause death in birds in less than 48 hours.

Rat bite fever is another disease that can kill birds.

There are many others.

I was living in Philly in an old row home. We had always had a mouse problem, so when my friend freaked out and said he saw I rat, I assured him that it was but only a small mouse. I was wrong. 
It was Halloween day and I was just getting dressed up ( I was the hulk that year and was wearing the full upper body suit that you can buy-fake muscles and all. I was half done painting my face when I heard an 8 year old girl scream coming from downstairs. I ran down as fast as I could and found my 30 year old roommate bent over on top of the dishwasher in the kitchen screaming that he saw a rat and it was underneath the dishwasher. As I was about to reassure him that it was just a mouse to my horror I see one of our sticky traps slide out from under the washer, turn on an a 90 deg angle, and pull free from a large foot. 
After some intense negotiations, we decided to block off the kitchen with furniture and don a weapon. My roommate grabbed an old set of horizontal blinds thinking to use it like a net. I grab a walking cane. We entered the death arena and kicked the dishwasher. The rat came flying out, it looked more like a small bunny as it hopped to exit the kitchen. Out blockade was a success and soon the beast turned it attention toward us. My friend tried to use the blinds to trap it but the animal used agility and began to charge me. There I was, dressed as the hulk, half painted face and everything went into slow motion. The rat charged me-teeth barred and I swung once with the cane. I missed and the rat began to leap in midair for an assault. I swung with all my might, this was a true max Payne slow mo moment as I connected.

10589,10589,202f7y,cfzi4mg,5,t3_202f7y,"I was working at a rustic tourist spot in the foothills of Colorado.  We sold fudge.  A lot of different kinds, including both chocolate and chocolate walnut fudge.  The way we told the difference was that we embedded walnuts in the top of the chocolate walnut fudge when it was still cooling.  Well, one day we were pulling the pans of fudge out from the cabinet shelves, and thought we had run out of chocolate walnut fudge, but it turned out only the walnuts were missing from the top of the fudge.

Now, we kept the fudge in a closed cabinet every night.  I checked it with the flashlight, and we couldn't figure out how a mouse could even get in.  We threw away a lot of fudge.  Apparently the rat (We later found out it was not a mouse) had urinated on the fudge (Now you know why I didn't tell you where I worked) and a customer called and said it had made her sick.  So we put out a mousetrap, but it didn't get anything, even though it was set off the first night, and never caught anything again (rats are smart)

Well, a few days went by.  There was a lovely young couple, in love, sitting at one of the restaurant's tables looking deeply into each others' eyes.  And a rat sauntered right out into the middle of the restaurant floor and stood up on its haunches looking around.  The owner's wife saw it and grabbed my arm, gasped, and started shaking.  She left bruises on my arm.  I calmly waited for the lovely couple to glance over and see the rat not five feet from them.  They didn't.  The rat then dashed into a tiny hole in the condiment island I hadn't even known existed.

By the way, this is a great metaphor for the obliviousness of those in love to life's sometimes ugliness.

Well, now we knew it was a rat, not a mouse, and a big, sleek, round-eared, bright-eyed walnut-fed rat, at that.  Now I was really perplexed.  How the hell did that thing find a way into the fudge cabinet?  I looked everywhere with a flashlight, but never could find a hole, of any size.

One of the other employees brought a pellet gun.  He promptly got into an argument with another employee who was a vegetarian and wanted everybody to know the rat was here first and had rights.  We decided ricochets were too much of a hazard anyway and vetoed the rat hunt.  I shrugged and asked management to send over a live-catch trap, with the intention of doing a catch, relocate and release far from human habitation (did anyone else used to watch ""Wild Kingdom""?).  

The live catch trap was slow to show up, and meanwhile the owner's wife bought a standard rat trap - it looked like a mousetrap, but big enough to break your finger if you messed up when you were setting it.  I baited it with peanut butter and a walnut.

The next morning I came in and management had dropped off the live catch trap, which was sitting on the floor next to the dead rat in the trap, which I disposed of before opening.  I told the vegetarian the rat was dead, and he indignantly pointed at the live catch trap and looked outraged.  ",t3_202f7y,1394503107.0

I had so many roaches I eventually just mentally surrendered.. Open the door to the bathroom, roach falls on my head, sweep it off, take my shower, move on. Sleeping in the middle of the night, roach crawls up my leg, smash it and go back to sleep. Pick up some old magazines off the table, roaches scatter, let them.

The only thing that kept me going is when I would take showers, sometimes the fuckers would be in range of the shower head. (In China, the showers can be the entire bathroom with a drain on the floor). I'd sit there spraying them around in circles, watching them struggle, eventually flushing them down the drain, watching them crawl back up only to be washed down again. I'd do this and just watch and wonder, if roaches got tired, cause it did seem like they would struggle less and less.

It's very unprofessional and non-productive. In addition he seems oblivious to the fact that just because he may be the HOA president that doesn't mean that he can just dole out fines at will. There is a violation letter, appeal process, Board hearing and fine procedure that's laid out in the bylaws and state laws that dictates the process that must be followed before fines can be assessed. Any fines that have sent out without following the proper procedures are invalid and unenforceable even if the actual original violation itself was legitimate. 

Also some of the things that he's complaining about will be hard to enforce. Trash bags just thrown on the ground *are* ridiculous but the problem is that you have to actually prove who threw it there to be able to fine someone for it. And unless he has a speed gun how can he possibly hope to prove that someone was speeding? If he tries to say that he just eyeballed it and the offender contested it there's no way that it would hold up in court. 

The problem is that these people know that most residents will just roll over and do as they are told and pay whatever fines that they send out whether they are valid or not because it's cheaper to just pay the $50-100 fine than to ""win"" spending thousands of dollars by having to hire an attorney and taking them to court over it.

10 years later, there were a bunch of new rules that had come up over the years, and they were breaking into my unit when no one was home to look for violations, saying that they suspected leaks, clogged drains, and various other things that turned out to be from other units (except once when we did have a leak).   
It happened really gradually and the newer owners were able to pass all kinds of ridiculous bylaws because they put them to a vote and outvoted the original residents.   


The thing with the cats was the final straw. I sold as quickly as possible and used the proceeds as the downpayment on a house in Boulevard Park, got a mortgage for the remainder, and rented rooms out to friends to help pay the bills. It's great! No HOA, neighbors are nice, get to live with people we like, and we have a huge yard that we can do whatever we want with, including growing food.   
The best part is that even if the neighborhood gets an HOA in the future, I'll be grandfathered in and can refuse to join.

The nother is frail from hunger and thirst after days of traveling the rugged wilderness with her Cubs.  Our eyes meet, this once beautiful and majestic creature's eyes hold a deep sadness.  She knows her time on this Earth is short and so she has traveled for days to come to this very spot at this very time.  I shift my eyes from hers to those of her pups.  They seem to be in much better shape then their mom.  I realize that she has been giving all of her food and water to her pups in an effort to ensure their survival even at the cost of her own.

  Our eyes meet again and a moment of understanding is shared between myself and her.  ""I have traveled for many days over many miles. You are the chosen one, the one that our legends have spoken of for years"".  I listen intently for what words come next ""You are to raise my children for I am no longer able to"".  I am taken back by this because I have three cats and hate dogs.  ""But how?"" I ask her, not sure that I am up to the task.  She seems to smile a little before saying ""come here and I will teach you"".  I get on my hands and knees, trying with all I have to imitate the mother wolf for the sake of the little pups.  

Closer and closer through the underbrush I inch my way towards them.  Soon enough I am with the mother and her children and for a moment all is right in the world as she whispers sweet nothings into my ear and I begin to fall asleep.  

A few days from now a group of hikers will discover me.  My body half eaten and my insides splayed across the forest floor.  The wolf and I had never actually spoken you see.  It was all a rabies induced hallucination, her smiles and words were in reality deep growls and the flash of menacing teeth.

I can agree w/ that statement. Banks would have thought twice about taking insane amounts of risk if there wasn't implicit assurance they'd be bailed out.

Governments are horrible and in efficient and evil and constantly throughout history have proven to infringe on our rights over and over.  

Most of the evil in the world is directly tied to big governments.  

Most of the evil corporations get away with is because of government help. Even the concept of a corporation is a government idea.  Corporations have limited liability with government protection.  

Jim Crow, Slavery, apartheid, black empowerment, affirmative action, rippling taxes, wars, genocide, and privacy violations are all done by governments.

In fact, taken a step further, the reality is that those who work is powerful positions in banks are self-interested. Having self-interested individuals run powerful institutions that pull the geopolitical strings of our age is dangerous.

I'm interested on what your metric is for defining the best or worst countries. 

Countries with a high quality of life have such because of economic freedom, not banking. Equating the two is a flaw. 

Now don't get me wrong, I think banks can be wonderful institutions. They're important. But I'd be a proponent of public banking. I don't think banks should make a profit for managing the currency flow or holding the funds of individuals. Such services are so integral to economic freedom, and therefore to the overall quality of life, in a given nation state that I think it's in the interest of the state to provide those services through taxes that are paid. Loans should still incur interest, the total of which could be put back in to state spending. 

But I think you're missing the bigger point. The advent of cryptocurrencies has opened up a dialogue that many people would have never even considered. Can we separate tokens of value from the state in which they're exchanged? Can we force oligarchial financial institutions to provide a fairer and more transparent service by scaring them into action? Can we create a system whereby people can create value without being charged for it? Yes we can. We can with decentralized tokens of value that rely on a transparent, secure and immutable ledger to broadcast activity. ",t3_8j6sa9,1526271899.0

Digital currency. Companies that issue tokens and provide bank-like services notwithstanding, I can't go get a loan from Bitcoin, Inc. nor can I get a mortgage from Big Bitcoin. It's a digital currency/commodity, it's not *banking.*

You're conflating the term banking with currency and liquidity. There was currency before there were banks, many different kinds of it. You're also confusing the ""macroeconomics textbook"" platonic ideal of banking with banks and banksters irl. 

Banks provide liquidity (to some, very conditionally) and do keep money safe (in theory, with the cooperation of a government which can print money at will). Beyond that, banks engage in predatory lending practices, insider information trading with both other major market actors and the government, and are a key pillar of the inflationary federal-bank backed petrodollar system which air-drops currency to privileged actors and manipulates the economy/credit cycle at will. 

Bitcoin does none of that sinister shit. Its inflation rate is hardcoded. It can't be manipulated by the powerful by traditional means. No one can delete your balance because you're a ""bad actor"" in the eyes of the government.

This is (or was)  the culture and the practice of cryptocurrency before all these twee ICOs started coming out promising to bank the unbanked and be exactly like the status quo except plus blockchain. 

So your assertion that banking = the original crypto is wrong on several levels.

Of you don't remember, or if you don't know, North Korea has been an explicit dictatorship for a while now. During that time they've had tighter sanctions placed on them by leading Western countries. This has made it incredibly difficult for North Korea to be economically progressive. Not because they don't have a core banking institution. 

Comparing North Korea and Africa makes no sense either. One's a country run by a dictator, the other a continent with many, many core banking institutions throughout. 

A lot of the problems on Africa hail from powerful parties trying to acquire resources throughout the area. There are many mineral and metal in areas throughout the continent.

In economics, the money supply (or money stock) is the total value of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time. There are several ways to define ""money"", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions).

Money supply data are recorded and published, usually by the government or the central bank of the country. Public and private sector analysts have long monitored changes in the money supply because of the belief that it affects the price level, inflation, the exchange rate and the business cycle.

Most of the secrets are open- there's a lot of diversity, for good and bad.  There's lots of restaurants, parks, and subway stops, but there's also a poorer and sometimes criminal element.  There's also a spillover from Columbia of well-educated younger people from other places who are doing well.  

As for specifics, there seems to be a lot of rapes.  Also, a lot of people looking for confrontations.  

Last year, a restaurant owner was shot to death outside his establishment while locking up.  No killer found, no motive known.  But for sure the locals didn't like the place because it was directed at an upscale audience.   

There's quite a bit of homeless right on the main streets.  Some are very aggressive.  

Lots of ambulance sirens, especially in the summer.  They're not supposed to use the side streets, but they do.  Sometimes they cruise up and down the main streets, 'chirping' their siren at every light, late at night.  They're not going anywhere, just making noise and having fun.

And the dirt bikes in summer.  Cops are complete punks when it comes to unregistered, unlicensed dirt bikes.  It's pathetic.  They have free range.  Which means a lot of crazy driving, and some drug dealing.",t3_dng6sn,1572141728.0

But let's not lose sight of this post's intent - While I was living there there were several acts of random violence that I witnessed. Typically gang related, but there was one point where these teenagers started throwing bricks at women's heads, the NYPD then flooded the area with an officer on every corner for over a week. My car was broken into and there was an area under the GWB where heroin needles were stuck into trees. It was all good as young lad to live there as it was VERY cheap and pretty nice neighborhood.  Trouble for me started when I got a beautiful girlfriend who started living with me - the cat calling and harassment was intense and upsetting to her.  12 year old boys telling her they wanted to fuck the shit out of her and snatching her cell phone. Lived near a Domino's and the drivers would bang on the window when she walked by.  I called corporate office and asked them how one should respond to their wife getting sexually harassed, received free pizza, an apology, and it did cease immediately for all women.

Final straw for me was one afternoon, hearing what sounded like teens fighting right on my door.  Door is rattling and everything.  Waited for it to die down and looked through the peep hole to see my neighbor looking shocked. I opened the door to find a trail of blood from my apartment to a guy laying in a pool of it in the hallway with another guy yelling over him. Police arrived and took him away, murder detectives showed up a few hours later.  The guy was stabbed over a drug deal gone wrong and died. They posted police at my door for the next week or so, and about a month or so later a swat team showed up breaking down another neighbor's door.  That was enough for me to move to Astoria.

So yeah, Washington Heights - beautiful parks, architecture, and scenery.  The dirty secret? It's still a pretty wild neighborhood sometimes. I see it pop up on local news still with shootings and pretty crazy stuff.  


Edit: Oh yeah and then there was the fact that it was the rapiest neighborhood in NYC.

Bensonhurst is mostly Chinese and Russian now; We haven't had a fresh wave of Italian immigrants since the 70s.

The twin cities can eventually get there, but we need to build out rail, both light, commuter, and street cars, all over the fucking place. That's going to take a cultural shift and people not being so gorram NIMBY and ""but muh carz!""

13339,13339,b3gul7,ej13yey,1,t1_eizw9ki,"From a rail technology perspective, I think maybe they should have focused on street-level trams versus light rail.  The downside and upside is they could be run on existing streets, which means they could have replaced buses and gotten people used to the idea of fixed pickup/dropoff points.  Some of the street-level downsides could have been eliminated with traffic signal prioritization and creating segregated area for tram stops.

The big failure for buses has always been their willingness to pick up people and drop them off on any street corner, combined with needing to go with traffic and traffic lights.  This makes them extremely time-inefficient for people who ride them, especially when contrasted with cars.

The problem with light rail is that it's pretty heavy rail and has a lot of right of way dependencies that make it expensive and complicated to add new lines.  Trams seem like a much better compromise than light rail, providing more urban reach and less infrastructure while still being useful at the distances our light rail lines extend.

I was in Amsterdam last December and the tram system there is fantastic, and surprisingly (or not) there was also a TON of vehicle traffic which never seemed to be a problem for trams.  I was even surprised at how much traffic (and parking!) there was in central Amsterdam.  I wouldn't think people would bother with owning a car or driving into Centrum given its density and how good mass transit is, but there I was, seeing cars in narrow streets and the canals often lined with parked cars (really anywhere there was space to park a car next to a canal).",t3_b3gul7,1553168134.0

Ive had men, complete strangers, come and wait with me and start engaging the guy at the bus stop because they saw me and got worried about wtf this dude was up to. I have literally walked over a mile to get to another bus line so I can avoid waiting around in a certain area at night. 

That said- 90% of the sexual harassment I've experienced has been mid-day not on public transit, so I do think the perspective is warped.

I'm not saying women are at fault for their harassment. Just that certain people's experiences are not always an accurate representation for someone else's.

And to be clear - I'm not just talking about sexual harassment towards women when I'm talking about certain people not understanding how to deal with public transit and the general population. A lot of these are things that apply to men too.  They also get harassed albeit in a slightly different way.

I'm not throwing the blame on women. I'm throwing the blame on passive aggressive ""minnesota nice"" culture which leads grown adults to implode in on themselves because they didn't know how to establish boundaries with a person who was picking up on their subtle social cues. And I'm including myself - when I first started using public transit I was totally overwhelmed and did not know how to handle these situations and they happened semi-frequently.

Yes, if you ride public transit especially outside of commuter hours *regardless of your gender* you are going to have to learn how to shut people down. It'd be nice if that wasn't true. But I don't think that's an issue of public transit. That's an issue of society. What I see is people from the suburbs coming into the cities and being completely overwhelmed and horrified by the realities of their community now that there's no economic segregation. Metro transit has done a really good job of staying on top of the issue and I'm really not sure what people expect from them. The issue isn't public transit, it's that we still have a lot of problems with homelessness and in particular substance use and mental illness. 

The vast majority of public transit in minneapolis is safe. Minneapolis is insanely safe compared to other areas. I have, as a 5'3 120 lb young female, walked around and waited for the train or bus drunk at 2 am and been totally fine. I've ridden transit daily for like jesus probably 7-8 years now. Yes, ever once in a while you will get harassed. I wish it was different. As a society we should strive to improve. And I'm not saying it's not a big deal. But it's just the reality of being a person. What I'm saying is more: there's no reason to be scared of public transit. The harassment you face will be no worse than what you've face before and what you run the risk of just walking down the street or popping into a store or a bar. There are only one or two lines and some sketchy bus stops that I would advise women against once it's late. 

Public transit isn't the issue. Society is the issue. And while there's definitely a conversation to be had about making society and public spaces safer for women, those are BIG conversations about incredibly difficult to solve issues. Lumping it together as ""women should feel unsafe to ride the light rail at night cause they're women"" is just promoting rape schedules. And my point is that if we're gonna talk about prevention techniques, I think de-escalation techniques are more useful and allow women greater freedom.

The biggest safety issue with public transit right now have been the assaults and if that's a gendered issue than it's actually more of a risk for men. ",t3_b3gul7,1553185820.0

There's a huge issue with enforcing behavior norms without it feeling like or actually being racial profiling, racial harassment or other kinds of racially biased behavior.

What's unfortunate about this is while it may make the subset of liberal political leaders and some of their followers happy, I'm pretty sure the net outcome is not a feeling of racial harmony, especially by riders who experience it.  It only perpetuates whatever biases they have as well as when they share their stories, enhancing other people's biases.  People do come away believing that policy makers and their agents are choosing to let specific racial groups ""get away with it"" and I think this makes them much more willing in private to endorse harsher reactions and/or just write off parts of the city as no go zones.

Personally I think we're all much better off with careful and measured responses which reduce uncivil behavior as much as possible, but I think this will actually translate to some level of police enforcement.  A lot of these people aren't going to listen to measured reason, they will only respond to certain level of applied authority.",t3_b3gul7,1553199192.0

At the end of the article you linked, it links to some of the empirical studies that have been done, and says that all but one found either a negative relationship or no relationship at all between raising the minimum wage and employment. The reason many of them find no relationship is because (a) many increases in minimum wage aren't enough to 'move the needle,' as in my $9 vs $15 example above, and (b) because there's a lot of illegal labor supply that gets paid below the statutory minimum wage.


Two thought experiments will make this really clear:

(i) Imagine the federal minimum wage law was $0.01, and congress magnanimously decided to raise it to $0.02. Clearly, there would be no effect on total employment.

(ii) Imagine congress decided to raise the minimum wage to $100 an hour. Clearly, there would be a massive decrease in total employment, as many people would choose to fix their own cars, cut their own grass etc. etc. rather than hire people to do it.

Also maintenance costs are relatively low compared to rent.

Not to mention an expense requiring a lot of money would most likely be handled by insurance anyway.

Of course there is not enough supply. There is not enough of anything in the world. That's literally the foundation on which the study of economics was created. Prices are so high because that's where supply and demand meet. There is no shortage of Manhattan housing *if* you have the budget to pay for it.

Again, rent controls affect that supply. The median income in Manhattan, for a household, is [$47,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Manhattan).

13998,13998,1eupqd,ca51smr,2,t1_ca4lpuu,"Ok, so I looked at my property outline last night.  Good news -- my memory does not fail me.  My notes say that 40% (in 2003) of NYC's housing market is regulated, either through rent control, rent stabilization or rent subsidy.  This effectively drives down the amount of free-market housing available, and thus artificially drives up the value of the market that is unregulated.  This makes sense -- it's econ 101.  Bad news -- my notes just generally cite to Schill for this proposition.  My recollection is that it's in several of his articles, and in his book on NYC real estate, but I can't seem to find the source in my quick perusal of my notes and case book.

14000,14000,1eupqd,ca52pn1,2,t1_ca51smr,"Aha! That makes sense to me. Rent regulation is very different than subsidization so now that 40% figure seems more plausible.  All I'll say is that housing regulation is much more complex than it's been discussed in this thread. There are regulation exempt zones in Manhattan, there are exemptions where rents exceed $2500/mo, exemptions for tenants with an income greater than $200,000/year and no one has discussed J-51 tax incentives or MCI rent increases on stabilized apartments. Too many people confuse rent stabilization with rent control and think of people with $300/mo 2 bedrooms. In many, many cases, those apartments are being illegally occupied and a diligent landlord can spend the money to get them out. Our apartments are all stabilized and our maximum legal base rent is almost always at or exceeding market value.  Thank you for going into your notes!",t3_1eupqd,1369396679.0

14431,14431,152bvl,c7irraf,6,t3_152bvl,"There are few examples of releasing predatory species to control a pest species which have actually had an overall positive effect. In fact know of none where that is unequivocally the case. This approach is nonetheless often one of the first solutions attempted to perceived pest population problems, and hence the source of many problems associated with invasive exotic species in all sorts of habitats around the world. 

There are three main problems with introduced predators. 

1. Getting hold of them and keeping them is difficult. Breeding predatory species is difficult and expensive, in general. They also tend to kill each other, and naturally occur at relatively low densities. Attempts to artificially raise their numbers usually result in many dying or moving out of the control area, as their population attempts to stabilise itself. 

2. Unintended side-effects - this is the big one. A predator that eliminates its prey population is not going to survive. So if allowed to behave naturally such a population would in any case never succeed. If a population does become established it can start behaving in unexpected ways. It is very hard to predict what these might be, and the examples, particularly in the new world, of introduced species causing havoc in native ecosystems are too many to count. [http://www.cbd.int/invasive/WhatareIAS.shtml] (U.N. CBD Invasive Species page)

3. The oversupply (or perceived oversupply) of the pest species is usually caused by something, and if you do not also address that root cause then the problem will probably not be resolved by introductions alone. So it is better to try these other solutions first. 

Concerning releasing a single gender of predatory animal. As a side-note I don't know how this would work but I would not be optimistic. Predatory animals are not simple killing machines, they form populations and interact with each other. Let alone the logistics of obtaining a large and constantly renewed supply of a single gender of these animals the resulting population would probably be so busy fighting itself that it would have little effectiveness as a predatory force.

14436,14436,152bvl,c7ivcip,4,t3_152bvl,"A common misconception about rats is that they live in subway tunnels.  There is no reason for a rat to live in the subway system.  It's dark, the earth is compact and hard to dig through, and there is no food source for them to eat.  The exception to this rule is when you get homeless people squatting in subway tunnels - there food will attract rats.  Rats live at individual subway stations.  They typically will live in the cinderblock walls.  At night, garbage is stored in sanitation rooms by the MTA, and is often disposed of the next morning.  The rats will come out of the cinderblock walls to eat this garbage, then they will eat the trash people throw on the tracks.  The rats you see in the subway aren't living in the system, they live in the wall you probably leaned against while waiting for your train.

I won't go into the problem of introducing a predator; I think the other comments have summed up why this big problem.  You technically cannot own ferrets in NYC, and they have been blamed for killing songbirds (wether or not this is true is debatable, since they also supposedly are used to pickpocket people).  Cats are great at killing rodents, but the food put out to feed feral cats will often feed more rats than the cats are able to kill.  Cats add to rodent problems.  Owls are great rat hunters.  However, they are very susceptible to rodenticides.  There are not many wild owls that unsuccessfully survive in NYC.  

The best natural predator you can find in NYC is red-tailed hawks.  Red-tailed hawks are diurnal predators and cannot be used in subways.  NYC's most famous hawk is named Pale Male.  He's 21 and has successfully fathered many hawks.  There are currently 68 known red-tailed hawks in NYC.  Unfortunately, these hawks are often killed by rodenticides ingested from poisoned rats.  The parks try and foster these hawks populations by banning the use of rodenticides.  Still, a red-tailed hawk can hunt over a 1 mile radius; you cannot keep the hawks from eating poisoned rats caught in areas that do use rodenticides.  As a result, there have been 4 hawks found dead this year alone.  These hawks, though good predators, cannot be expected to control the hundreds of rats you can find living in just one park.

The best way to treat a rat infestation is sanitation.  I can try and find studies if people want it, but sanitation has been found to be much more effective at controlling rats than poisons.  The next step taken should be to rat proof the area with the infestation.  Sanitation and rat-proofing will dramatically reduce a rat population.  So if the solution is rather simple (properly dispose of trash overnight, and seal the cinderblock walls), why do  we have a rat problem still?  Money.  There's never enough money.  The MTA never seems to have enough money - they are more concerned with improving lines.  The city recently cut the sanitation budget.  There isn't enough money to ""simply"" dispose of the garbage earlier.  Still, the best way to control rats, in your home, parks, work, or subway, is proper sanitation, not predators.

Domesticated ferrets are simply not equipped to survive in the wild.

They are now driven by nothing but curiosity.

Dog:  Play with it.

Most successful predators are successful because they're generalists...so they may just go wipe out a totally different prey species, die out and not effect the target species. It could even wipe out the pest species competitors - benefiting the pest species.

There's a reason why a ""mechanical "" removal is preferred. Wildlife biologists aren't idiots. They've considered this and moved on thanks to the massive risks involved. And if people are concerned about rats in the sewers they should focus on making it a less beneficial habitat to them rather than wipe them out. They're rats - the most prolific expansionist mammal outside of humanity probably ever. Even if you wipe them out they'll be right back.

Shin's love was only for my master and rather than see him fight Saki for her hand, she persuaded Yoshi to flee with me to America. But Saki vowed vengeance. I remember it well, as my master returned home to find his beloved Shin lying on the floor, and then he saw her killer. Saki wasted no words, and during the struggle, my cage was broken.

Also, if they were standing on the wooden rail tie when they contacted.  Probably fine.  On a metal spike or nearby metal conduit, not so much.

Basic laws of electricity apply, specifically Kirchhoff's circuit laws and Ohm's law.  The cat, or any object for that matter, has to complete a circuit between the third rail (~625 Vdc, with tens of thousands of available amps of fault current) and an electrical ground.  For comparison, household voltage is 120Vac and often protected by a 15-20 A circuit breaker.  The third rail is quite deadly, should it find ground through a low resistance source.  ",t3_2t1nkx,1421798180.0
14840,14840,2t1nkx,cnvhn7c,1,t1_cnvhe36,">""third rail and an electrical ground."" 

I figured this too but I always see rats crawl under the third rail w/o any shock/arc, which confused me. Arent they technically grounded as they are touching the ground? Or is there no conductivity on the ground; hence the wiring of the other rails? 

EX: a human or long animal has it's legs on one of the rails and touches the third rail: arc/shock/death. Same situation but, no rails and feet on ground: arc/no arc?",t3_2t1nkx,1421798634.0
14841,14841,2t1nkx,cnvhwtb,1,t1_cnvhn7c,"Usually the ground just below the third rail is either dryish dirt or a wooden railroad tie.  They both have very low conductivity.  Plus, the rat is furry.  All of these things add up.  

A human would have a similar effect.  There are people who use a helicopter to attach to live 500,000V electrical lines and crawl on them for maintenance.  If they came within 10 feet of a ground, they'd be instantly vapor...

The human body (dry, clean and properly hydrated) has about 100,000 Ohms of resistance. Wet or broken skin may drop the body's resistance to 1,000 Ohms.  Dehydration similarly lowers it due to increased electrolyte per volume.  

The human body on dry soil can withstand about 50-75 Volts from head to toe.  Add rubber shoes and that number doubles.  Put rubber gloves on or EH shoes and that number can multiply by 50 times.  Stand in a puddle and that number drops, significantly.  

Ground is very relative.  A human on the ground in the subway is likely touching some metal.  Most likely another rail, standing in one of those stank puddles, or holding onto something for balance.  All things that wil kill them.

If you sleep in shelters every night, and your goal every day is to get there first so you can grab your spot in the shelter, you're really missing out on some of the best stuff the AT and a Thru has to offer. This is just my opinion, but it is unequivocally true just the same. HASH Force 5 came together for the first time on Cheoah Bald where we caught sunset, a red moonrise, and then sunrise the next morning. I'd wager most people never experience that sort of thing in a lifetime, and those who stayed at the shelter below that night sure didn't.

I will just add a bit of a counterpoint to this discussion, because I think it's ultimately down to your purpose for hiking the AT. A thru-hike of the AT is really physically stressful. A successful thru is a huge endeavor, the success of which is largely dictated by your ability to recover physically on a daily basis, as well as your ability to manage your energy levels and by extension your morale. If completing the AT is your biggest priority (and not something else like weight loss, enjoying the outdoors, making friends, escaping your daily grind, or whatever), and if to maintain the energy and motivation to complete the AT requires that you cut back on other stuff, then you either have to acknowledge that and move on or re-evaluate your goals. If your priority in hiking the AT is to relax, then for some people a thru-hike is probably not the right goal. At no point did I ever think to myself while hiking the AT (and I'm a LASHer not a thru hiker) ""boy this sure is relaxing, like a good vacation.""",t3_c3av92,1561153920.0

Funny, I don't regret skipping any of those things. After a while, with a few exceptions, the views all looked the same to me. I definitely had a ""if it's not white blazed it doesn't count"" mentality. Even walking in town to the diner felt like a chore. I fought hard not to laugh this one time when a local found out I was hiking the AT and started suggesting other hikes in the area I could do while I was in town. ETA: I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression. I was polite and thanked the guy for his suggestion and did my best to be a good ambassador for the trail. I just found it ironic in a way -- the pressure of a thru hike or LASH makes you less inclined to be spontaneous, which is probably the opposite of what a lot of people who don't hike the trail would assume. People ask if you carried a fishing pole, or post here on Reddit that they plan to take a lot of wildlife photography.

There are a bunch of brownstones near my apartment, and a couple are being heavily renovated. The contractors block off the construction sites by setting up these green wooden boards along the sidewalk. These boards don't sit flush on the sidewalk--there's usually a small gap of a few inches between the cement and the bottom of the board.

Across the street from the construction site is an elementary school, and on this particular evening there was some kind of function at the school. A bunch of kids and parents were spilling out onto the street. It was an unusual number of people for that time of day, so I was distractedly looking across the street as we walked past the construction site.

I had the construction site to my right, my girlfriend to my left. I'm kind of in this stoned daydream when my girlfriend shrieks and jumps about 6 feet in the air. In that same instant I see in my peripheral vision some brown mass emerge from beneath the wooden barrier to the construction site. By the time I looked down this filthy fat fucking rat the size of a small dog has already climbed onto my shin and is hanging on my leg like a koala on a tree.

I kick my leg like I'm doing a bad impression of a Rockette and this fat fuck arcs through the air and lands like a bag of wet sand several feet ahead of me. It somehow squeezes back beneath the wooden barrier. My girlfriend and I run across the street to process this violation.

By some divine providence I was wearing pants rather than shorts. I was wearing light colored khakis, so you could actually see where the rat was. On my shin was a huge skidmark, which must have been from the sebum and grime of the rat's fur. Closer to my knee was this brown wet spot about the size of a quarter. I don't know if that was from the rat's mouth or asshole or what. Those pants went straight into the garbage.

The reason I suggested you pay rent is to avoid the landlord suing ""you"" for non-payment of rent and you ending up on the dreaded Tenant Blacklist. 

I did recommend you initiate a tenant HP against your landlord and the City of New York (for not enforcing) - in which case you should not end up on the tenant blacklist and get the repairs that you need.

You have done an excellent job in photographing your horrible experience with Metropolitan Property Services (landlord).

Metropolitan Property Services needs to address the root of the problem which is the balcony and perhaps the outer walls of the building near your apartment.

RENT HISTORY FOR RENT REGULATED TENANTS: Ascertaining whether or not you live in a rent-stabilized apartment is the best reason to request your rental history; and whether you are being charged the proper amount. It can also indicate, if there is no rental history for your particular apartment, whether or not your apartment is ‚Äúlegal.‚Äù 

To get your rent history:

Apartment rents are registered annually by building owners with DHCR's Office of Rent Administration.

Call the Rent Infoline at 718-739-6400. The rent history will be printed and mailed directly to the apartment/building address.

I practiced L&T law for a number of years, and I've never met a tenant's lawyer worth their salt who tells their clients not to file an HP because they'd end up on the blacklist. Unfortunately, L&T is a field where there are more bad attorneys than good. It doesn't meant that they're not smart, well-intentioned, or experienced -- but at the end of the day, L&T is volume work and most practitioners, especially solos, just don't have the time or means to devote to analyzing complicated cases. This is especially true if your lawyer also represents landlords or does general practice.

Obviously, I don't know who your lawyer is -- and again, she *could* be right that filing an HP gets you on the blacklist (I'm still really skeptical of this) -- but unless she's from a major tenant firm, I would suggest you get a second opinion.

When did I say he wasn't ENTITLED to repairs.  Of course he is ENTITLED to them.  But that a theoretic question.  The real point is, how can get it fixed and his options are:

(1) Sue and be blacklisted

(2) Pay for contracter to do it and take money out of the rent - this may also lead to being blacklisted.

(3) Complaint to media or government, and be blacklisted.

(4) Do them himself (or pay cheap contractor to do so) and then have landlord reimburse for minimum cost.

The leak is more complicated. Is a roof above you or another apartment?

As for the ants, Wilcox gel every single gap in your apartment. Add borax or some home remedy.

I really don't think that's true but can accept that you have a different opinion.

Agree, but that's what I suggested.  Only the way I suggested it was slightly different. I recommended that HE do it himself (to minimize cost) and that HE keep receipts and take it out of his final month's check (or the month before that if he fears not getting the deposit back).  If a contractor is NEEDED then that would be the next logical step.  You and I just disagree on whether a contractor is needed.  Also you don't seem to agree with me that getting a high priced contractor will likely INCREASE rent the following year which is something I assume OP wants to avoid (which is why I said to do it himself).

> Why would the landlord reimburse them in a timely manner if they've already shown they're inattentive to the problems in the first place?

That's our issue.  You read ""reimbursement"" (fairly so) to mean the landlord would actually PAY the tenant.  I meant it in the sense the tenant would take it out of the rent.  We were saying the same thing.

My girlfriend and I were once meeting at the subway‚Ä¶ we were at the same crowded subway station and figured we'd just find each other at our stop. So we both get on, we're on different train cars. And obviously, no service on the train.

They kept announcing they would be skipping the stop we were getting off at. I was going to text my gf to get off at the stop before. But I couldn't get service to tell her. But she's smart. I figured, she'd just do that.

I get off. She doesn't. She texts me later. I'm all the way at stop X‚Ä¶ wtf. I said, they announced a million times they were skipping that stop. Why didn't you get off before? ""I had my headphones on and didn't hear the announcements.""

There's likely many other scenarios where not being able to hear what's going on around you is not good. Missing a subway stop isn't a huge deal.

You shouldn't wear headphones in public.  It's important to be aware of your surroundings, and hearing is a very important sense.

The sounds of the city are just white noise.  It shouldn't bother you.  Maybe you need a day or two to get used to it.

> Rugs and Rug pads

These are a tripping hazard and they also ugly up most spaces.  Your noise complaint is silly as it will only provide some minor benefit to your downstairs neighbors.

> A good backpack

Unless you were homeschooled, you should already have one.

> A sun hat

Ridiculous.  NYC is 98% indoors, and the rest is covered by the shade of skyscrapers.  If you're getting sun in New York, you're doing it wrong.

Reading about specific violations may still be rather misleading, but it can often give some good insights as well.

You know that you can safely disregard this.  If, however, there are violations regarding evidence of live mice, I will be rather more hesitant.

I don't have numbers, but I'd bet that the number of restaurants getting fewer than 14 points previously was **way** lower.  Now, part of this is definitely because all restaurants are doing everything they can to get an A.  But there has to be something else going on too right?

I suspect the inspectors are coming to restaurants and getting their own overall impression and using that as a guideline for their grade.  So if they come in, see that everything looks very clean, safe and overall well run, they will decide to give that restaurant an A.  So they note a few violations and add them up, but not going over 13 points.  Also remember, until a very recent law that stated all restaurants receiving A's would not have to pay fines, each violation meant money for the city.  Just like parking tickets, health code violations are revenue.  Even the cleanest places will get violations because that's what is paying for everything.  Just the way it is.  

Is this bad?  Well, I would encourage an inspector to use more common sense to grade a restaurant.  You walk into a kitchen and look around a bit, you get a pretty good idea whether their food is handled correctly or not.  On the other hand, this adds to the subjectivity and inconsistency of the inspection process.  Instead of common sense, the inspector might use prejudice or stereotypes to influence their results.

First, our immune systems are better than people think.  Second, food that has ""gone bad"" tastes, smells and looks horrible.  Years of evolution have developed our senses to detect it.  Ever smell or taste a bad oyster?  Trust me, you will know if it's bad.  On the other hand, tainted food such as a piece of chicken with e coli or a piece of fish containing a parasite tastes and looks just fine.  So for the most part I'd say that street food is just as safe as anything...it might be *dirty*, like literally there's dirt on the food.  But it's got the same chance of being tainted as anything else. ",t3_fckqp,1296633235.0

2) Fast food establishments have crazy resources to develop systems to make sure they all comply with the health code.

3) They also deal with a lot of packaged, prepared and frozen items which also make it easier to handle within regulations.

If I'm not clear on some of this, forgive me, English is almost my native language, but I still make mistakes when I'm really mad. Like NOW. 

I hope you did tell your husband, even if he didn't see it. These things have a way of coming out. In addition, since there was no return address, that rat could easily have been meant as a threat to your husband, and should have been reported IMMEDIATELY. I don't know how long it's been, but I'd def still take a chance and report it, UPS and other delivery services keep track of deliveries for a LONG time, and it could still be investigated as a thread. There's also the issue of them wishing you would be killed by a terrorist. Hajji? Seriously? Do they even know what the word means? It is someone who has been to Haj, not a fucking Genii, like in I Dream of Jeannie. Ignorant, racist motherfuckers. If you got that bullet threat on social media, that can be traced even if the user deleted it. If by email, voicemail or text, EVEN BETTER.

Police banging on your door is a good deterrent to future harassment. I hope nothing like this happens again, but if you can, please think about reporting it. If only to prevent your husband from asking 'why didn't you tell me', if another event happens. Such as a nasty or threatening letter, someone taking bad pics of you with bedhair and posting them on social media or any petty thing that can be mistaken as some kind of implied threat.

I'm not sure I believe she trained any rats to 'take a selfie', as much as she trained a rat to crawl onto a guy ... or found people willing to wait around subway stations with lunch meat on their laps  long enough for her pet rat to crawl onto them. The selfie was an afterthought, just a photo someone took and shared of the bottom of a rat's face.

The pizza thing is just a rat carrying pizza, it's a cute video but what training exactly went into that? Film a rat near a slice of pizza long enough, see what happens. I bet there are a bunch of drafts videos of the rat just eating it, not carting it off to save for later.

On a weird note, when stressed or ill they can develop pophyrin staining around their eyes and nose. This tends to scare the crap out of the uninitiated because it kinda looks like blood at first glance. If you live in an area with access to a ""pocket pet"" or exotics veterinarian, it's worth giving them a call if you see staining when it doesn't make sense.

If you gently scoop the spider up with one of these they tend to stay nestled in the filaments and don't make a run for it - maybe they feel safe surrounded by the filaments, assuming they can't be seen - making the process of getting them outside much less fraught, with almost no chance of damaging the spider.",t3_2hxxx4,1412152227.0
18793,18793,2hxxx4,ckxb8l5,4,t3_2hxxx4,"Sounds like a Giant House Spider. It's unusual to see them during the Winter unless you go looking for them.

They vary a lot between different houses... for example I used to live next to several large fishing lakes. In summer there would be loads of flies over the lakes, which the spiders live on and I recall one week over summer when I found a new giant house spider for about 5 consecutive days. The place I live now is 4 stories up a new apartment building and I've only ever seen one small one in here over nearly 2 years, in the bathtub on the day I moved in (probably just because the house hadn't been occupied for a month).

Anyway, your best bet is to make your house as spider-unfriendly as possible... so try to avoid it getting damp, kill any flies that get in and leave the windows closed as much as possible. Also, cruel as it sounds, I just kill them when I see them - otherwise they'll breed and you'll never get rid of them. They also seem particularly talented at getting back inside your house after you chuck them out the window. 

In about 4-6 weeks the temperature is going to plummet and the spiders will disappear. ",t3_2hxxx4,1412152765.0

She makes little cobwebs in the corners which I remove when they get too big, but other than that we're pretty chill with each other. She keeps my room free of flies, doesn't seem all that annoyed with me for throwing her babies out the window and stays away from me so for the most part I leave her be.

The spiders in the garden that weave the massive webs (like the one by your window I imagine) are also cool to stay. As you say those big webs destroy all the flies that are attracted to the dog shit in my neighbours garden. There was one that kept weaving in front of the shed where I store my bike so I was having to destroy the web twice a day to get/put back my bike. Then one day, it started weaving a different shaped web that didn't go over the shed entrance. I'm honestly not making this up. That was a couple of weeks ago and I haven't had to destroy the web since.

You are right to be concerned about this, this is the truth.

Unfortunately all of NYC has a rat problem, but your landlord is legally required to abide by basic sanitation regulations and to take action. Keep track of all your correspondence and **politely** **ask** your landlord to take care of this by putting new trash bins in and take pest control precautions around the trash area via rat poison boxes. Let him know that you will be contacting 311 on monday if there has been no action taken to solve the issue and you hope that your landlord takes action before you have to make that call. If they don't respond or send someone to the property this weekend, call 311 and let them no you have a pest infestation and your landlord has neglected the issue and refused to respond to your complaints.

For one, there is only one road that connects Alaska to the rest of the continent; the AlCan highway. Rig that up with mining explosives and nobody is driving into Alaska. 

This goes for many of the port towns sprinkled throughout the Southern region of the state. Knockout the single connecting roads and those port towns are now useless. This goes for just about every population center. Airfields can be destroyed to ward off flights in.

Also, the sheer vastness of the state, it's inhospitable terrain and long, deadly winters would go far to even the playing field to such an overwhelming invasion force of 8million. The Southern region of the state is covered in impassable forests and mountains. Alaskans are not only well armed but also well stocked (relatively) for outdoor/subsistence survival via skill sets, supplies and equipment. Should forces start to invade, Alaskans have a huge advantage in exercising guerilla tactics to pick off the large swaths of NYC invaders. 

All that said, I think odds are stacked in NYC's favor given the sheer volume of people, the biological warfare potential in rats (as opposed to wolves) and resources at it's disposal. Certainly for R2; No way are Alaskans making their way across the continent to invade a city they want no part of, let alone defeating 8 million people who could be easily shored up in high rises.

A few dozen rats could chew a human to pieces. Humans run from rats, not pigeons. Rats are EVERYWHERE in New York, as well. Pretty much every building in New York has rats, whether or not the owners are willing to admit it. They live in the walls, the sewers, the floors, the streets, the alleys, vents, anywhere you can think of. Also they outnumber the pigeons at least 8 to 1. There are an estimated 1 million pigeons in NYC; while the number of rats is almost impossible to accurately estimate, it is known that they at least equal the humans in number. That's 8.337 million rats to control. I could have them dig a tunnel into a bank, or pick up change citywide and bring it to me. I don't know how much the random sidewalk change throughout New York is worth in total, but I'd guess in the hundred thousands. I could have the rats eat anyone I didn't like, or just crush them in their sheer mass. I could ruin any restaurant I hated. Geez, I'm getting dark. Oooh, I could just release them all onto Times Square and Wall Street just to cause mass panic and to confuse biologists for decades to come.

I do think giving dogs a job to do is a good thing, whether its doing some dog sport or a natural one like this. Theres a risk in anything you do with a dog, even taking it to a dog park. They arent super delicate critters that will fall over at some illness- but you do the best you can to use preventives, be clean, and treat them if they do. If my dog were interested in ratting, thats how I'd handle it anyway. I'm sure country vermin have diseases too though I dont know the rates vs crazy mutant new yorker ones lol. I am interested to see what kind of impact this has on the rat population. I know farmers or other workers in the country will hire terrier ratters to clean up a barn and really do a good job when traps didnt but RATS doesnt seem like a big professional crew and nyc is an entirely different monster.

There is a genetic gradient that you can see across Manhattan island and the rest of New York City as rats typically stay within their own groups that stay within a few blocks. Because of this, rats uptown don't really interact with downtown rats and so they don't exchange their genes as much. This leads to different characteristics in mice in different locations i.e. Different ""breeds""

I become so antisocial after a night out with anyone else except my few close friends.  Too many people here are trying to sell you on a version of themselves and are snobby for no reason.  Of course, you don't know that it is for no reason, because why would someone build up a huge facade about being rich if they were actually living paycheck to paycheck?  Well, people want to get to the top of the heap, so will lie hard to get there.  I feel average in many ways, but can fit in with ""higher class"" people but also have ""lower class"" friends, and when you're here, you feel that divide, if you want to or not.  Now, I don't judge based on it, it's more that I noticed how OTHER people react to some of my friends.  I've seen (former) friends and acquaintances completely ignore or be rude to people I loved because they weren't hot enough or  seemingly rich enough, or lacked in some other superficial way.

>	Data analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that, in 2015, the vast majority of people enrolled in Medicaid‚Äî77 percent‚Äîwere in a household where at least one adult was employed (full- or part-time). A full 37 million enrollees, more than three in five, were members of households with at least one full-time worker.

>	The CBPP points out that more than half of SNAP recipients who are able-bodied working-age adults are working while receiving benefits, and more than 80 percent are employed in the years prior to and following participation in the program. Among households with children, the rate of employment surrounding SNAP participation is even higher.

>	The 2015 report by the U.S. Census Bureau confirms that many recipients of other government assistance programs are employed. About 1 in 10 full-time workers received government assistance in 2012, while a quarter of part-time workers did.

>	Of course, rates of participation in the six major government assistance programs are much higher for those who are unemployed (41.5 percent) and outside of the labor force (32 percent). It's worth noting that those who are employed are more likely to be short-term rather than long-term recipients of government assistance. Nearly half of those who are recipients from homes with at least one full-time worker participate for no longer than a year.

>	All of this data points to the fact that these programs are serving their purpose of providing a safety net in time of need.
