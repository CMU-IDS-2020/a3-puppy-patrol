I didn't like the density. But friends and gf convinced me to give it another chance and this week we had a free place to stay. After 2 days of living like a new Yorker I gotta say...
What an absolute disgusting city this is. The entire city might as well be a landfill that people pay too much to live in.

Everything is too small, I feel like I'm living in some dystopian future mega city where over population has gone to soylent green levels. 
Everything is over priced. The food, the drinks, even the fucking water. A 6 pack of bud lite and a bottle of regular, filtered water cost me 30 fucking dollars. Some under cooked, yet burnt hamburger was $25. What the fuck is this city made of? Gold? No, its made of fucking trash. 
Everything is old. The apartment we stayed had a shower that looked a fucking roman relic. The microwave was so old that I felt like it was cooking my insides just as much as the food.
The trash, this city is a fucking landfill. The subway is a fucking rat infested sewer fill with homeless people. Oh and the homeless people, they're all crazy, unhinged, and violent psychopaths. 
I looked up property prices here because I'm looking for a housing investment and what a fucking shit show. A studio condo is Chelsea is 750k, not including monthly HOA. I mean I fucking knew NY was expensive but this on a whole another level. Fuck, you couldn't pay me to live here.

Shit, no wonder so many comic book villains are constantly trying to destroy ny. after living here for a week I would too!

Edit: thought i give out some perspective. I live in DC,  and I love it. It's no mega city but its no means the county side. I don't hate big cities in general, I've been to/lived in Boston, LA, Miami, Beijing, Tokyo and thought they were fine. But seriously, fuccccccck NYC

Edit2: Jesus fucking christ people. I didn't buy the Bud Lite, I just noticed the price. What I actually brought was   Peroni. Bud Lite is a lot easier to spell for dyslexic like me.

New York City is a Shithole,8254,bnmu4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bnmu4j/new_york_city_is_a_shithole/,1698,1557649835,"Seriously. Everybody loves to love the Big Apple, but it’s not that special. It’s cramped and smelly and filthy. Most of the “historic charm” are tenement buildings that used to be slums that got converted into hipster condos. All the real New Yorkers who used to make New York edgy and full of character can’t afford to live in New York. Everything is cheesy and ridiculously overpriced. The drinks are watery and everybody wants a fat tip just for showing up. Also, everything is either busted or under construction. Even Broadway sucks. You can see great shows anywhere in the world now. The NYC subway is creaky and busted and full of crazy drug addicts and nasty hood rats that just wanna fight. Also: actual rats. And Brooklyn is full of insufferable wannabe artists that are posing on Instagram on their way to their pizza jobs. 

So you can have New York. Place smells like ass.

EDIT: To the supposed ""New York Insiders"" who accuse me of being a tourist, never having left Times Square, or that I just don't know the right ""cool"" neighborhoods: Yeah, that must be it. I just haven't found the next Greenpoint yet, or whatever. Bitches, I am OLD. I knew New York in the 80's, 90's, 2000's and I know its latest Disneyfied version, which is duller and more of a big dirty mall than anything else. I still come to New York almost monthly for work. And I can hack the city just fine. Spent most of life living in cities of over 5 million people. Just some cities function better than others, and New York is not one of them. After a while, one has to ask themselves, why are they putting up with this shit, and paying double for the misery and the stench?"

I want to pass forward a few items that seem to be lacking, I was traveling for 5 weeks and upon my return there were and are a number of things that are going to be addressed by the Board:   
**You have until Saturday, June 29, 2019  11AM**  


**Patios:** Read your Documents and House Rules move to get those things that are allow and NOT allowed OFF THE PATIOS: the patios are a limited common area NOT a STORAGE area, if on Saturday anything is on your patio you will be fined; some owner as directed, informed the Board of ongoing issues- or have prior approval for items that are on the patio, but it seems to be some misunderstanding on the Patio items, but that will end. NO excuses, NO warnings- FINED and you can see the Hearing Board.   


**Dumping/Garbage:** if your dumpster is FULL walk to another dumpster- leaving your garbage ON THE GROUND and piling it up like a NYC GHETTO is unacceptable and will be met with a $500. Fine! Illegal dumping is different within the Documents as you can clearly read, if the HOA is charged for the Waste Management people to clean up the area, on TOP of the fine, your unit will be assessed the other outside cost as well, such as the Landscaper cleaning up the debris and as most owners here KNOW WE LIVE NEXT TO A GREENBELT/Apartment  with rats/mice/raccoons/rabbits- WHY WOULD A PERSON or PERSONS leave their garbage on the ground to be FOOD for those and other animals is beyond ME and others! But if it takes, FINES at an extreme level then, that's what will happen.  


**Parking:** if I inspect the parking lot and see any vehicle in our visitor parking without proper stickers- YOU WILL BE TOWED! If you or your renters PARK in another's owners CLEARLY marked parking stall you will be towed and that offender (if a renter or NON OWNER) will be removed from parking on the HOA property- get your Documents out and Read them the HOA absolutely has the power to remove and rescind any privileges that are afforded to an OWNER! This behavior will cease or the average cost for a tow is $450. And daily storage cost on top of that is $85 a day- DO NOT PARK IN SOMEONES stall, without their written permission! And renter better start moving their car(s) every 24HRS! Or they will be towed NO QUESTIONS ASKED!-  we have renters here with 3-4 cars! That is coming to an end, harshly to the owners who clearly are not monitoring their Renters! It is not the BOARDS responsibility to address your renters, they are NOT OWNERS- and as owners you better grasp this or we will fine you, take your rental funds until the fines are paid off in full- if you don't think that can and WILL happen you should read the Washington State Statues (RCW's) on ""rental intercept"" -- Time to get things back in order!   


**Speeding:** Any renter(s) seen AGAIN speeding around this property will be REMOVED! Again, if you are an owner and you are doing so WHY? OUR INSURANCE IS at stake!  We have small children/elderly/and pet owner walking around the property and I have witnessed the speeding- and one renter the same renter got a very direct message! OUR insurance cost for the property is HIGH ENOUGH! Tell your renters to cease their behavior or they will be parking elsewhere! The Board /Owners control the common areas, such as the driving areas to your assign stalls! If you think I will not enforce this to cease the reckless/dangerous/deadly  behavior you are very WRONG! If you are a NEW owner, get your documents OUT and read them because I hold you to them, as we are held as Board members.   


If you disagree with the above, I am not worried, nor concerned.... what I am addressing are the areas that are blatantly being abused to the detriment of all owners and their VALUES to their investment!  


**Come Saturday morning 11AM- unless you have been given prior approval to items on your patio, you will be fined/if you are the ones who are PILING garbage on/around the dumpsters ground/ and your renters are Parking/Speeding/And has more vehicles than registered with the Board on the property- sooner, I assure you rather than later you will be seeing the Hearing Board...and those vehicles will be towed.**"

A bit of perspective on MetroTransit and the lightrail,362,b3gul7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/b3gul7/a_bit_of_perspective_on_metrotransit_and_the/,126,1553113040,"Student at the U of M here currently spending Spring Break in New York City working on photography projects. Recently on this sub and some of the other twin cities subs 

I've been seeing a lot of complaints about how MetroTransit handling the light rail (smoking, fare skipping etc.) and as someone who rides the lightrail most days and has been using the NYC subway to get around I gained a lot of appreciation and respect for the lightrail. The light rail is clean, well marked and usually roughly on time. The NYC metro by comparison is filled with rats and trash, the cars are old and dilapidated and the time tables are non existent (i.e. you need an app or something to see when the next train is arriving at most stations). All of these complaints about the light rail suck, and stuff I wish wasn't an issue but id still ride the lightrail any day over the NYC metro. 

Of course this doesn't take into account ridership, budget, size and so many other variables. . . But I guess I just wanted to provide something to think about. I think the lightrail (and the bus system too) are managed extremely well considering their size and budgets and we should all cut them a little slack as they try and clean up some of the issues right now. 

Obligatory ""you might disagree"" which is cool, just my personal experience with the two systems. "

THREE! 

Ok. This is a bit ranty. I know the obvious snarky response would be: Well move. Sure, I may be able to move elsewhere and get a job. I don't want to, this is my home, I am a taxpaying citizen, and furthermore, there are people who *can't.*

Edit 1: Holy fuck wow, thanks for your responses! I wrote this with a momentary fury - a primal response from looking at my ConEd bill. I did not know so many people would get involved (and subsequently school me on microeconomics.) We can talk economics as much as we want, but economics is not a philosophy. We can, through policy, shift market incentives that may make living in this town more sustainable. My point about produce: im not just whining over a bruised apple, it is that this apple cost me $2, and that a decent grocery store with a fair price point has no place to be in the city, it is an unsustainable business model.

The city needs to either drop the costs to landlords, through taxes, water, electricity delivery. Or subsidize to say the least. They need to subsidize the rents of people who are *middle class* as well. Cities are beautiful things, cities keep our carbon footprint lower exponentially from those of the suburbs. Bastions of creativity.

Please: I need to know if I should call the police,328,iaskoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/iaskoi/please_i_need_to_know_if_i_should_call_the_police/,27,1597585516,"This is my first time posting to the boards. I’m here because I need help / advice. Of course neither of my brothers answers their fucking phones. I am completely terrified by what I have just witnessed. This happened ten minutes ago… my adrenaline is out of control… let me get it all out and stick to exactly what I remember. If anyone has any advice on what to do please PM ASAP!

My name is Adam and I live in Ocala, Florida. We’re in the center of the state and there’s not much going on here. I was recently furloughed from my job at a local media company on account of Covid and so I’ve been hanging at my apartment and applying to basically every job I can. Playing a lot of video games; trying not to go crazy. It’s been a weird year so far and I haven’t felt like myself.

Ten months ago, I signed a lease on this one-bedroom apartment in a nice gated community when I moved down to FL from NYC with my girl. The relationship didn’t last and now I’m here on my own trying to figure stuff out with a global pandemic making everything more stressful. Now this nutty shit happens today with my neighbors… and I need to know if I should call the police.

Not to get political, but we’ve had a huge disparity in responses to the pandemic, and so I’ve been grateful that my community has been super careful about wearing masks, distancing, etc. It’s a mixed family community but there are a fair amount of retirement-age folks and we are all conscious of that. I actually had Covid back in April but luckily was low grade symptoms.

This morning: I get a text from my neighbor, Jerry. I’ve met him and his wife Ethyl a handful of times. They are both older and live in the unit next to mine. Totally nice people. I think the guy made good money in real estate or something. The only thing is they have significant health issues. Ethyl is overweight and has cancer. They’ve been staying home since the lockdown, etc.

So you can imagine, I haven’t seen much of them for the past few months. And then I get this text from Jerry today saying that he has a very important package that has arrived from UPS but he is nervous to go to the mail room because of the surge and the fact that Ethyl is not doing great apparently. He asked me if I could go to the mail room and drop the package on his doorstep.

No big deal, right? I said sure. Happy to help. This was… I dunno… 20 minutes ago? I went to the mail room. Jerry had called in that I would be grabbing the package on his behalf. The guy at the concierge went to get it. He was grumbling about something, and when he handed the package to me, I understood why. I am not joking: the UPS box smelled like absolute shit.

I couldn’t believe it. We looked at each other; he made some comment, but at that point I was grossed out, said I needed to drop it off, and left. Thankfully our units were close by and I jogged over to Jerry and Ethyl’s apartment.  Trying not to think about the rancid smell. Not only the stench, but also the fact that the package had a *warmth* that I suddenly noticed.

Anyway, I got to their place, and went to drop it on the stoop. When I rang the doorbell, the most god awful pungent smell of rotting waste hit my nose. I realized it was coming from inside the house. The smell was so bad that it startled me. I felt sick and **immediately** became worried because if you had smelled this… it was just… it was hot, and wet, and, and INTENSE!

“Adam?” I heard Jerry on the other side of the door.

“Jerry?” He sounded… strange to me. “You guys alright?”

“Yes, sir. We’re both holding up okay. Thanks for helping out.”

I asked about the smell. He laughed and apologized. Said something about a rat dying in the walls of the house. I told him straight up it seemed worse than a dead rat and I was concerned. He laughed again and said this had happened before. Nothing to worry about. I asked about Ethyl. Jerry said she was okay and needed a lot of rest these days on account of her medical treatments.

At that point, I became aware of what I can only describe as a “humming” sound from behind the door. Not only did I feel like I could hear this humming sound, but when I came close to listen, I felt this inexplicable tingling on my face. It was very subtle. At first I thought I was sweating, but the humidity wasn’t bad, and I realized there was just, like, this *sensation* on my skin.

“**THAT’S NOT VERY NICE!”** Jerry screamed on the other side of the door.

His cry was so completely fucking unexpected that I stumbled backwards.

“Oh, sorry, Adam!” His voice was light again. “Was only kidding with you!”

At this point, I was so utterly unnerved that I decided to get the hell out of there. Just one of those bad feelings that you can’t ignore. Didn’t say anything to Jerry, just dropped off the stoop and turned to leave. Then – I don’t know what possessed me to do this. There was something about that humming noise that got in my head. So I quickly slunk around the side of their apartment.

I was consumed by the urge to see what was going on inside. If you heard that noise… you would have done the same. Now, the units in our community are pretty private; Jerry and Ethyl almost always have the blinds drawn. That not really strange on account of the heat in Ocala. So I decided to sneak around to their fenced in back yard where I was able to see through the kitchen window.

God. I wish I hadn’t looked. I… I don’t even know what to write. There were… people in the kitchen. I’ve never seen Jerry or Ethyl entertain guests, and I *know* for a fact they don’t have family in the area. And yet I saw at least eight or nine people. They were half-naked. I saw open boxes, like the one I had delivered, everywhere. These people were rubbing this… this *crap* all over the unit!

I cannot explain it any other way. I stood there for maybe 30 seconds staring at this scene in disbelief. These people were reaching into the boxes and smearing whatever the hell was inside all over their own bodies, all over the floor, the walls. That’s when I saw Ethyl. She was the only one completely naked. Ethyl was standing by the far wall, and SHE was the one who was humming.

This humming noise… I will never forget it. What freaked me out even more was that Ethyl… she looked so *different* than what I remembered!  She’d lost so much weight. It was unbelievable. Then, she looked up. Ethyl saw me through the window and *she started to cry*. The humming stopped, and the people in the kitchen stood very still. They turned to me - each person weeping.

I ran back here so fucking fast. I’m losing it and pretty much think I'm freaking out. Please: I need to know if anyone has any explanation of what just happened.  I’m wondering if it could be related to their medical issues, etc.?? I am okay to call the police if necessary; I just don’t know what to say. I may actually leave my place right now for a bit and go figure this out somewhere else.

If you are not enjoying yourself why are you out here... take some zeros, explore the awesome towns around the AT. Have fun. Meditate, relax, let go of worries. Of course there are people that love the challenge of 40 mile days and that’s their relaxation and that’s awesome for them, but if that’s not you, don’t stress yourself out. You’re out here because you’re on an adventure you want to remember for a life time, not to be apart of the “hikers rat race”. I’m so conditioned to be in the rat race in New York City and it’s hard to escape those patterns of behavior and thinking. It’s hard work training yourself to relax, take it all in, and jus enjoy yourself. You should be proud of yourself if you achieve that. Don’t beat yourself up and stress out. Hike your own hike, love the trail and it’s people, and work on taking life on slowly."

[the leak that keeps on giving](https://reddit.com/link/9m9w5v/video/lf2whq4onuq11/player)

This is just a few of many photos and videos I have of what I have endured the past 4 months of living in my new apartment on 180 E. 17th St., Brooklyn, NY 11226.  The initial leak started in May and has been a constant in my home and it is now October.  I have had my computer ruined, 2 modems and 2 routers replaced, mold, gnats, flies, carpenter ants, constant mildew stench, no hot water in the mornings the entire month of May, warped flooring, cracked plaster and paint and basically not being able to use a quarter of my living room because there is always risk of water dripping on my belongings.  I have called 311 on them so many times and they have been fined many a time but they don't seem to care!  My property manager will not return my emails or texts.  He has only returned my calls a handful of times promising repairs but every time someone has come to repair I have never seen the walls or ceiling opened up and I have only seen them plaster and paint over when it has leaked and as soon as it rains again, it starts pouring in through my ceiling and walls.  They took 5 months to replace my flooring that was warped allowing the carpenter ants to invade.

I spoke with a tenants’ advocate and she suggested I create a blog and make the address and their name public. She also suggested I send them a link to the photos I post online and that perhaps this will get them to make the repairs I need. She suggested I apply for a rent abatement and take the high road and pay my rent so that they do not take me to court for an eviction non-payment case which could result on getting me on the tenant blacklist.  The blacklist is a serious and real thing.  Once you sue someone its on public record and someone compiles these names and sells this list to real estate and property management companies to ensure these tenants are never rented to again.   So it's a great tactic for slumlords to intimidate their tenants into not taking any real action against them.  It may not happen to you but it's still something to be cognizant of.

&#x200B;

Currently, I have trouble breathing while in my apartment and as soon as I leave I am fine so I know there is mold in the walls but they have repeatedly told me there isn't when they have done nothing to check.  I am at my wit's end.  I have consulted with 2 lawyers and a tenant's advocate and I wanted to put this out into the Redditsphere to see if they would make repairs from some public shaming.  I also just wanted to let everyone know not to rent from these people.  I have made a forum [http://180e17thst.boards.net](http://180e17thst.boards.net) for others renting from them to display their grievances in hopes repairs will be made.  Other people in my building have also had many problems and some of them have been here for years.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, don't rent from these people, and always check the building history and apartment history of whatever you are looking to rent -- ESPECIALLY if it's rent stabilized.  Rent stabilized tenants see the most ill-repair because it behooves the landlords to get as many people in and out of apartments as possible because they can raise the rent each time.  I didn't realize they could do this to rent stabilized apartments. I thought rent stabilized meant they can't raise the rent willy nilly.  So if you see a lot of commotion on a rental history then that is a bad sign.  You can also look up how many violations have been reported on 311 for an apartment.  Be smart when renting in NYC and anywhere!  I've certainly learned a lot with this experience and will be much more savvy next time!

Hungry rats start attacking diners. NYC.,190,hqeomy,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/nyc-rats-attacking-outdoor-diners-201628328.html,51,1594644635,

Quality of life improvements in NYC,176,j956n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/j956n8/quality_of_life_improvements_in_nyc/,167,1602421993,"I'm very big into ""quality of life improvements"" -- things that will make my life easier or more comfortable. To that end, i have been compiling a list of some NYC specific ones:

1. Noise cancelling headphones. I cannot recommend these enough. They make the ambient noise so much more tolerable, so much so i can *read* on the train. Right now i'm using [these bose headphones.](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/noise-cancelling-headphones-700.html#v=noise_cancelling_headphones_700_triple_midnight) They're among the best on the market for noise cancelling, but some other bose models are superior in other aspects.
2. Sound dampening blinds & curtains. These also happen to be very good at blocking light to, as well as keeping heat out in the summer, so I consider that a triple win. For blinds you specifically want [cellular shades](https://www.lowes.com/pd/allen-roth-AR-1-5-in-White-Blackout-Recycle-Cellular-Shade-34x64/1002819654) (or so i've read are the best for sound dapening). For curtains you'd want something thick, they sell curtains that promise to deaden sounds ([like these one's I got](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KNQ7XZZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)). The curtains and the blinds combined do make a meaningful difference for certain ""frequencies"" if I understand correctly. They don't keep all the sound out, especially lower sounds like heavy bass, but they make a difference with things like fireworks or that constant ""low level"" din you always hear throughout the city.
3. Rugs & Rug pads! This is in a similar vein as the above for noise reduction. Half the issue with noise is it getting into the apartment, the other half is it staying in the apartment. If you have a pre-war apartment with a high ceiling like myself then you likely have a terrible echo. A police siren driving by makes that echo infinetly worse. Putting rugs down and pictures on the wall has decreased the meaningfully. The rugs also makes footstep noise much more tolerable, and *maybe* keeps some sound out of the apartment for people below me and such. **If you have kids or a dog, seriously consider getting good rugs and a rug pad**, for neighbor below you will be thankful. Rug pads make the carpets signficantly more comfy and effective.
4. A good backpack (preferably expandable). My old military backpack broke, and i just got this [this](https://missionworkshop.com/products/the-vandal) as a replacement. The expaning from 29L to 60+ is awesome.
5. A sun hat. The sun here is harsh. A good widebrim hat will help keep you much cooler (in addition to preventing sun damage to you skin and eyes), you'll show up much less sweaty to places, and feel much more comfortable walking outside in he sun. [This is what i use.](https://www.columbia.com/p/bora-bora-ii-booney-CU9107.html) You may look a bit silly (hat dependant), but you'll feel a lot better walking in the sun, as well as save your skin and body. 
6. Hand sanitizer on a keychain. Quite a few people do this now as well. I highly recomend it, even if you don't give a rats ass about Covid, it's nice to still have clean hands.
7. Earplugs! I sleep in earplugs, and its made sleeping much more comfortable. It took me a while to find an earplug that i was happy with (i have small ear canals apparently), but they are worth the effort. [These are what i use](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RMFGGY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apip_z3QHHeDA1lupS), a new pair every other night. So about a years worth for <$20
8. [Alpine Cockroach bait](https://www.amazon.com/Alpine-Cockroach-Bait-Rotation-Reservoir/dp/B0881LVXDQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=alpine+cockroach+gel+bait&qid=1602423311&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFHUUc2WDdCVDhGMEImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxMjk5MDUzR0IyNk9NVlM5T0g1JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyNDA2NzIzVUw5NE1QOEZTNUdRJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==). This stuff changed my life significantly. I used to see 10+ roaches a day. Everytime i walked into the kitchen or bathroom i was guaranteed to see a roach. Now I maybe see a roach once a week. Note: This stuff will cause the roachpocalypse. Shortly after putting it down the amount of roaches you see (and their behavior) will be crazy!

That's all the NY specific one's I got, does anyone have any more?

\--------

Here are some misc quality of life improvements i'd suggest:

\- An electric toothbrush. If you're like myself and brush half assedly, and sometimes skip brushngs, then an electric toothbrush will help pick up the slack. But regardless, i think it is still an excellent investment.

\- If you smoke weed regularly: A vaporizer. [I use this](https://arizer.com/solo2/), though preferences vary. Bonus points if you run the vapor through water. You'll save weed, be more discrete, and feel better physically and mentally"

"I just got an ""A"" from the health department.  Some thoughts from a chef on inspections in nyc.",165,fckqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/fckqp/i_just_got_an_a_from_the_health_department_some/,62,1296503698,"x-post from [/r/KitchenConfidential](http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/), a new reddit for restaurant workers.

*I'm Executive Chef of a fine dining restaurant in nyc, just so you know my perspective...*

Everyone with any restaurant experience knows that health inspections are extremely stressful.  During inspection, most managers and chefs are freaking out, causing the rest of the staff to do the same.  For good reason too...not a lot of restaurants survive for long after being shut down for health code violations.  

Last summer NYC changed its system from what was essentially pass/fail to a letter grade system: 0-13 points for an A, 14-27 points for a B, and a C for 28 points and above.  28 points (now a C grade) remains constant as the ""fail""-point, requiring monthly re-inspections until the point total falls below 28 or the restaurant is shut down by the city.  The point system, inspection procedure or regulations didn't change at all...what changed was the letter grading and the added rule that the it had to be posted ""where they can easily be seen by
people passing by.""

And it's a critical change at that.  For every restaurant in the city to be required to post a [giant letter grade](http://i.imgur.com/7kKRp.jpg) from the department of health on the front door is no joke.  I've always run a very clean kitchen...for the benefit of sanitation and of staff discipline.  Even I was fucking scared as hell.  

Why soil ourselves so badly?  

Well, having everyone that's walking in or walking by see a letter grade on your front door or window is a big fucking deal.  Even bigger than most think.  It doesn't matter if people don't know what that grade really means (and they don't).  People will see an ""A"" and feel great about going in.  People will see a ""B"" or ""C"" and the reaction would be anywhere from turned off to being completely disgusted.  The nyc restaurant scene is absolutely cut throat, too many restaurants...and no matter what you're offering, someone else is doing the same.  So, for taco restaurants the competition went from all *restaurants serving tacos* to *restaurants serving tacos that have an ""A"" hanging on their door*.  The other places are irrelevant and cannot compete to make real money and/or survive until they achieve the ""A"".

New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene knows this and it is in fact the point of it all.  They’re working to make restaurants take their inspections  even more seriously or risk going out of business.   Which sounds great to just about everyone too.  But there are a couple of major problems here…

**1) The outcome of health inspections are often unpredictable and depend on a number of uncontrollable factors.**

This. Is. Fact. Ever been to the DMV?  Or the post office?  Or the police station?  I'm not trying say people in civil service are all terrible, I'm saying they're super inconsistent.  One day you go to the DMV and the person is an absolute delight...efficient, friendly, helpful with addressing your concerns.  The next time you get someone who couldn't care less about you and doesn't mind letting you know it.  Or sometimes you get pulled over for speeding and the officer lets you go with a warning.  Other times he/she gives you the ticket while looking for reasons for more, giving you a condescending lecture the whole time.  Not sure why but people in civil service seem to be the most inconsistent workforce anywhere.  Maybe it's the hiring procedure, or the candidates they receive, or the nature of the job and their salaries?  Or maybe they're just as inconsistent as any other group, it's just that we expect them to be otherwise.

Well, health inspectors are civil servants too, and are *wildly* inconsistent.  Some of them are strict and thorough, but use common sense and reason to guide their process making them fair.  Some of them seem to be out to find every single violation or hint of one in an effort to inflict the most damage on your business during their visit.  Some of them don't really care about any of it and breeze through the inspection.  I guess they're human, and the worst of them are technically abiding by the rules stated.  So is the cop that adds on a ticket for not using the turn signal while pulling over.  Just saying that the inspector you draw is a huge factor that you have no control over.

Also, **restaurants are fucking crazy.** Huge places filled with food, employees, customers, garbage, chemicals, fire, water and anything else you can think of.  A restaurant is like a living being and to judge it based on a snapshot taken at a random moment is a problem itself.  Again, we got an ""A"" on our inspection, but I'll tell you right now there were days when we wouldn't have.  The day fruit flies just showed up and decided to make a home in our lounge.  The day the street pipes got all messed up and flooded a corner of the basement.  Or when one of the fridges was running a few degrees warm.  Sometimes one of our 80 employees forgets to label something or the steward misses a dented can and puts it on the shelf with the others.  A million things can and will go wrong on any given day, and of course we deal with them quickly to get everything soignee again. But should you be having a bad day and the inspector arrives, all you can do is scramble a bit and pray you don't get points for it.  Which brings up the other thing...

**2) People have no fucking clue what an A, B or C grade really means.  Meanwhile they're being encouraged to make decisions based on them.**

Decisions that affect small businesses.  Small businesses that each employ anywhere from a handful to hundreds of people.  It's not hard to predict a diner's thought process in relation to health department letter grades.

**I'm only going to restaurants with an A!**

*Um, excuse me.  I'm sorry to bother you but...do you know what the grades really represent?  You know, a B grade actually isn't th...*

**I don't care!  A's are better than B's!  Everyone knows that from years and years of school!!  Why would I go somewhere that's not as good?**

And that diner is right.  There's no reason for anyone to go to any restaurant without that **A**.  On top of that, someone sees a **B** and thinks ""Oh, they didn't get an A.  I wonder why?"", and proceeds to think about rat droppings, cockroaches, fight club, etc and runs away disgusted.

But do you know what makes a **B**?  Well we said already it's 14 points.  Points come from violations.  Some examples (each violation's point value has a range, the inspector is to judge the severity and assign the actual points):

Side towel left on counter top - **5 to 7 points**

Refrigerator above 41°F (even 1°) - **7 to 10 points**

Refrigerator missing thermometer - **2 to 5 points**

Any fly (*food and/or non-food areas*) - **5 to 8 points (28 if it's really messed up like Temple of Doom style I guess)**

Aaaaand we're at around 20 points!  Don't forget that these violations' points sometimes stack too. So for instance, if there's another side towel sitting out somewhere during the tour it would add another 5 to 7 points.  That would put us in **C** territory.  On a side note, having a larger restaurant with more employees is obviously a huge disadvantage.

The point is that the letter grade **doesn't actually mean anything close to what is being perceived.**  How about a 13 point **A** vs a 14 point **B**?  Or two **B**s but one had rotten meat on the hot line and the other got 6 points because a line cook was drinking a cup of water in the kitchen? (Yes, that's a violation)

Here's [Grace Green on Huff Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/19/city-inspections-reveal-n_n_810872.html) with a typical clueless blog post.  She gleefully says that Le Cirque and Gramercy Tavern (large, well known restaurants here) received **C**'s, indicating they had over 28 *violations* which is plain wrong.  28 *points* make a **C**, and we don't know how many violations.  Again, you don't know because you can't tell because the letter grade doesn't have that information.  This is someone writing an article on the subject and still has no idea how the system works and what the grades mean.   The hilarious thing is that they don't mean anything until you investigate the violations.  (You can find full details on each restaurant's inspection [online](http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do) but I seriously doubt anyone is going to bother to look past the letter grade)

And so these are the grades that everyone in the city are now judging us on.  And it's a shame.  I'm all for strict health and safety standards for diners and employees everywhere.  But the DHMH didn't think this through before implementation.  It's made slipping on a health code a potential death blow to an entire business and the income of its employees.  

I take great pride in the work I do, as do the vast majority of us in the industry.  Like I said, it's competitive, but that's a good thing.  If you're running a restaurant, no matter who you are or where you work...in this town you're battling guys like Mario Batali, Daniel Boulud, Eric Ripert, Nobu, and Gordon Ramsey every single night to get people into your seats.  The criteria should be the product we work to produce, as a whole.  Certainly our health and safety standards are part of that.
 
But as it is, it's about that damn letter grade first.  Just doesn't seem right.


tl;dr Health inspection letter grades are too vague and arbitrary to have the so large an impact on a restaurant's ability to compete and survive.

The Reason I Went NC (The trigger shot),153,desn2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/desn2i/the_reason_i_went_nc_the_trigger_shot/,15,1570495733,"Edit: Grammatical Errors/ misspellings.

Warning: Mention of emotional/mental abuse. I’m okay with some advice but I will mention I am currently attending therapy. My therapist diagnosed me as a “parental child.” Due to my mothers neglect. I am current NC.

Background: In my other posts on my profile I mention I am currently an Active Duty Military female. I am also married to another ADM member (My Husband). 

Now I always knew there was something wrong with my upbringing, I just didn’t realize the extent until I started dating my husband. At the time we met (We were in training school), I was still paying bills for my mothers home. Of which, when I mentioned it to my husband (to his horror), he gently as possible explained how that was really inappropriate. Right when I stopped paying, (at this time I also received orders for overseas) my mother called me. She called me to let me know the apartment she lives in with my 3 other siblings is going to be foreclosed on. I stuck to my guns and did not give any money (although I ended up amending my orders to be stationed stateside, closer to them in case something did happen). Surprise, surprise, she didn’t lose the house. 

Cue for the next couple of years of dealing with comments of “Your SO is just like your father you should leave him” (For some background my Dad was physical abusive due to anger issues. He has since attended therapy, apologized to me, remarried, had 4 more children and we both have progressed towards a healthy relationship). “You should leave the military, it’s just not you.”/“When are you coming back home?”/“I don’t thinks it’s fair your spending christmas with SO’s family.” /“I know you sweetheart, you will do the right thing and come home.”

I dealt with constant verbal lashing about how I should leave the military, how that since I married someone in the service, I should just use his benefits. That my husband, for the sake of “family togetherness”, should move closer/live close to HER.( For context my husbands family lives in Virginia and she lives in NYC) I always tried to steer the conversation elsewhere, I constantly asked her to respectfully stop of which I was mostly ignored. Every time she would use the same line “I am your mother and I’m only telling you what’s best for you.” Never mind that everyone else is proud of what I accomplished. She always pushed her agenda.

Mind you this behavior only started after I joined the military. Before that, I endured constant threats of being kicked out of the apartment (Of Which she was barely ever home, she was always at a friends or at her on again off again boyfriends house in NJ) I wasn’t contributing enough financially. (She even changed the locks on me when I came home one day) How I was worthless for not doing well enough in college (meanwhile I was expected to help my siblings in school and do my own work) and how I would never find a good man because of how lazy I am.  Meanwhile I paid bills, bought groceries (even though we had food stamps) and cleaned as much I could, working 2 part time jobs (waitressing) and attended full time college (Community College). What infuriates me the most, was finding out my father was still paying child support for me during this time period. Something like $1750 a month.

For those who read up to this point, I always tried to keep peace, but this was the moment that finally made me snap. Now again, if you read some of my prior posts, I share stories about my mentally unstable sister and how my mother would often placate/enable her destructive/abusive behavior. 

It was a normal summer day when I received her call. “Your sister is pregnant.” In the most happy/excited tone in her voice. I was stunned. (When I would mention kids my mother would go on tangents on how she was too young to be a grandma and we are too young to be thinking that way, mind you we brought it up when I was 26y old. )My sister was 21yrs old at the time. I knew she just started dating someone new (They were dating for 2 months at this time)She dropped out of college after one semester. She has been bouncing to and from minimum wage jobs opening credit cards and maxing them out ruining her credit, and from what my younger brother told me, she has been drinking and doing drugs in the apartment when my negligent mother isn’t around. I heard the blood rushing through my brain. I could barely hear, let alone comprehend, what my mother was saying to me. “What?” I replied. She then proceeded to say “Whatever your feeling you need to shut it all down and be supportive of your sister.” 

It’s like it all clicked into place. “No.” I replied. 

“Excuse me?!” She said obviously upset.

“I said no.” I replied. “How are you okay with this? She still lives with you, doesn’t have any aspirations to do anything better with her life. She has been underage drinking for YEARS. She just started dating this guy you have no idea about for 2 months. She was committed at the hospital for 24 hours due to suicidal behavior JUST LAST YEAR and was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She doesn’t take care of herself, or really care about anyone else. And now, you are asking me to support this person. The same person who can’t even give a shit enough for herself, let alone 2 cats, of which one died due to neglect! That I’m supposed to support that person with an infant. No. The only way I would EVER support that infant would be if she signed over all parental rights to myself and my husband after birth.”

I left her speechless. For like 3 seconds. “How dare you! This could be the moment that turns her life around! Becoming a mom changes you. Her boyfriend said he’s gonna do the right thing and marry her! She’s also working at Outback so she has a job! I don’t understand why you hate your sister so much! She told me she’s moving into her boyfriends (mothers) house! You should be happy for her and be willing to do anything to support her!” 

I felt like I had been slapped with a hard dose of reality. See, my mother was pregnant at 18. She had me and married my dad “to do the right thing”. They had a nasty divorce and both my younger brother and I dealt with the animosity/anger/abuse for years. She then remarried another asshole, had 2 more kids, of which the asshat left us HOMELESS. Throughout my life I watched the struggles first hand. And here she was. As If she was proud of my sister following IN HER EXACT FOOTSTEPS. I felt sick. 

I told her her “I need to go.” I hung up. Later that day my uncle called me. He was like an older brother to me and supported me when he could.  He tells me he heard about my sister and how worried he was. (My grandfather told him about it) That she contacted him just the week prior asking for $300 to go to disney world. (She went down to Florida from NYC and demanded the money from my grandparents who reside there, when they didn’t give it to her, she went to my uncle.) He also told me that they were expecting as well (Of which I was excited for them, I know my uncle will be an awesome dad). He calmed me down. It cheered me up.

That night I received a text message “HOW DARE YOU TELL YOUR UNCLE ABOUT YOUR SISTERS PREGNANCY! ( I didn’t) YOUR UNCLE DIDNT SUPPORT ME WHEN I WAS PREGNANT! (Mind you he was 12 when she was pregnant) HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING SO HURTFUL?! I didn’t answer. I was mentally checked out at this point. The next day I got word that my husband and I received orders to Colorado.

I told my family. I then received texts from my sister. Threatening me, and my husband. How my uncle and I made this stuff up because we wanted to take the attention away from her. How she hoped my uncles wife (my awesome aunt) would suffer a miscarriage and I finally catch a haji bullet. (which I work with computers sooo like WTF?) I had enough. I replied back. “You obviously want me gone. So, done. Consider me gone, i am no longer your family goodbye.” I blocked her off everything. I blocked my mother off everything. 

And suddenly it was as if I could breathe. I cried. I told my husband and bless him he held me as he told me, he was here. That I did the right thing. That I don’t owe them anything. The next week there was a package at my door. No return address. When I opened it, I WAS HORRIFIED. It was a dead rat in a ziplock bag. I threw it away before my husband saw it. (I knew he would flip his lid if he did, He was already stressed enough with a job deadline with highvis.) I kept to my guns and remained NC. One of my friends back home (who happened to be friends with my sister on instagram) told me she put up a post saying she lost the baby due to trisomy 13 at 12 weeks. When I spoke to my younger brother, he told me she was still drinking and doing drugs even after she knew she was pregnant. I felt relieved. I PCS’d with my husband and tried to stay NC since. (more on that in different post)

For those who read this far, thank you for reading. This has really helped me vent out my frustration and feelings on the matter. Therapy is also helping with recognizing my emotions and dealing with them properly. Feedback/advice/words of encouragement is welcomed. Thank you for everything!"

26/f. Something had to give. My roommates are bullying me. My boyfriend dumped me and broke my heart. My workplace is a mess and constantly fucking up and giving me extra responsibilities with little pay. Phone broke and I have no money to replace it. This is only my 5th month living in NYC and I feel like things are out of control. 

On the upside my family sends me enough money a month to cover my rent, but that's all. 

I just can't work retail. I can't do this rat race, struggling for a paycheck shit anymore. So today I'm pawning some things and buying a laptop. I want to spend my time learning web design and programming, so that I can eventually build a career from home. In the meantime I'm thinking I'll build resumes for people from Craigslist for $15 a pop or something. Money to eat. 

If I could find a simple part time job that would be ideal, but it can't be too demanding. 

Please wish me luck. 

Edit: All of you have made me feel so much better. Since posting this this morning I've already gotten one resume request from craigslist! I'm starting to feel that this is going to end with me being in a much better position. Thank you all so much. You're awesome. :)"

There are several of them, this particular shelter is one of many run by CADV or center against domestic violence. This morning I heard what I had suspected for a while, one of my neighbors is beating her little girl. I heard the cries and screaming and smacking sounds from the hallway. I had been wary of this woman for some time, she had come to my apartment in the shelter a handful of times, and each time she was constantly yelling at her daughter over nothing. It was obvious to me from day one this little girl was terrified of her mother. The verbal and emotional abuse was evident, I have told the staff about it more than once. The director of social services told me she didn't think it was true ""as of right now"". They aren't reporting it. The course of action, I'm being told, is to talk to her. Seriously. They are mandated reporters. I have been sick to my stomach all day. This woman acts like her child is the worst human in existence, but she is adorable and lively and sweet. 

I landed here because I married a psychopath disguised as a human, the man never hit me in the 7 years we were together until the day he pulled out a knife because I stood up to his mind games and verbal abuse. It's been a long difficult road and we are still not safe. The shelter ignores or covers serious health violations, and the state inspections are a joke. There is a ton of verbal abuse from staff members, threatening to send us to worse shelters and throwing away all of our belongings. The idea that there is help for battered women in NYC is a joke. The HRA hands out housing vouchers so that we can get apartments, but we are given no help in finding housing, and landlords and real estate brokers refuse them even though it's an outright violation of the human rights law. 

I have been grateful for a place to sleep that is warm and dry, I can live with the roaches and occasional rat trying to gnaw it's way into our room, but I'm sick over this glossing over a small child being beaten and warnings going ignored. "

Eric Yearwood moved to NYC to pursue a career in acting. After struggling to get gigs for sometime, eventually he got a call from a woman calling herself Zardulu.

She said she wanted him to star in a [viral video in which a rat climbed into a sleeping man's lap in a subway terminal](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5CvWXG8gqEU) and used his phone to take a selfie. 

Zardulu trained a rat to do just that. With the help of a ""witness"" (also in on it) who filmed the whole thing, the video made its way to the media and indeed did go viral. Then eventually, an anonymous caller ""ratted"" Eric out to the media as having been involved with a staging. 

Some time later another subway rider, Matt Little, recorded [another video of a rat dragging a huge piece of pizza](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UPXUG8q4jKU) down a flight of stairs. He swears he merely happened upon the scene and is in no way affiliated with Zardulu or Yearwood. 

But, might this have still been a Zardulu trained rat and another of her stunts? There were some questionable people nearby who appeared to be homeless and perhaps facilitating the situation. According to Little's friend, Pat Baer, one man was tossing the rat food crumbs and a woman was holding people back so that Little could continue to capture video. 

There have been other rat videos as well, including [cannibal rat](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ypUzFbthEJg). 

How many of these rat escapades are being staged by Zardulu? What is Matt Little's level of involvement - innocent passerby or conspirator? What other high strangeness in the NYC area can be attributed to Zardulu? She claims to have big plans, and Eric Yearwood seems to believe she is capable of pulling them off.

So today was finals, and I got to my building at around 7:30 AM, yet the test wasn't going to start until 11:10. Alright, I thought to myself, cool. I'll have some time to waste playing mindless games on my laptop.

So I open up my MacBook and start up a CoD 4 game, and I get going. Pretty soon the noise is dwindling down in the commons and I look up to see nearly no one around. So I check my watch and see that *three hours have gone by*. It is now 10:30, and I haven't studied one ounce for this test. So I'm all like, ""well fuck,"" and I open up my notebook and start reading frantically.

Thirty minutes later I've made virtually no headway, and already know the material well enough to have a B+ going into the final, so I just think ""fuck it, I'll do it."" So I throw the book in my bag and walk off to the room where the final was going to be held.

Two hours later, the final was literally one of the worst tests I've ever taken. Fuck, it was hard. It seemed like I only knew the second half of the test because that was the most recent stuff we reviewed. So I've got that sinking feeling in my stomach because I know it'll be eating at me for the entire four-day weekend we have after finals.

Boom. My brother texts me telling me to meet him at the car. Alright, I go and throw my bag in the back, and he tells me we're going to Safeway to grab a bite to eat with a few of my friends. We hop in my car and drive off.

We get to the Safeway and walk in, heading straight for the Deli. We order and the time to pay comes up, so I reach into my pocket and grab my... fuck. No wallet. I didn't even think to bring it to the final because I thought I was heading straight back to the dorm to grab a bite. So I plead with my brother to let him cover me, and he begrudgingly does with four bucks to spare.

Cool. We eat, even though my brother and I have nothing to drink. So after we eat he tells me to pick up some milk for him and whatever I want to drink. Taking the money, I walk over to the dairy section and browse for a bit. In my sleep-deprived state, I fail to notice the little quart-sized things of milk, and instead think the only option is a bottle of Darigold ""milk"" that has chocolate and peanut butter flavoring and ZERO DAIRY.

But of course, I grab two, without reading ANYTHING. I'm like ""well it's brown, it must be chocolate milk."" Did I mention I'm DEATHLY allergic to peanuts?

I buy them and go back, and my brother's like ""what the fuck is this."" So I look at it and FAIL TO NOTICE THE PEANUT SHIT and say ""it's milk, dude,"" and of course he's like ""whatever,"" so bottoms up.

I drink the whole thing in one sitting before my brother lightly taps me on the shoulder and points to the peanut warning.

So there I am, waiting for the anaphylactic shock to set in, and grapple with my backpack to pull out my Epi-Pen when I realize it isn't there. I didn't repack it with the rest of my stuff after going on a trip. So now I think it's my final minute on earth.

I start scrambling around and screaming ""DOES ANYONE HAVE AN EPI PEN"" (getting lots of looks) when my brother taps me again and points at the ""artificial flavoring"" part of the label. So now I look like a complete idiot.

So we drive off, a very embarrassed me in the passenger's seat (my brother insisted to drive because I might still have a reaction) towards the swim team practice, jamming out to some great djent.

So we get to practice and the FIRST THING my brother does is *tell EVERYONE what happened.* So now I'm the laughing stock of the team.

Alright cool. Great. I'll never be able to live on my own.

PSA: Tenant Rights in NYS,111,iajaxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/iajaxp/psa_tenant_rights_in_nys/,10,1597539674,"Hey guys, 

Recently I've seen a lot of my friends and people I know dealing with their landlords doing things that are either very legally gray, or that are blatantly illegal.

I've spent a decent amount of time reading up on tenant laws (I guess everyone needs a quarantine hobby), so here are a few things that I've heard of landlords trying to do to my friends and to people I know that are not legal in NYS.

1. Limiting occupancy: I've seen some tenants telling people they need to get approval to have people visit or stay over. Under Section 235-F (2) of NYS Real Property law, ""It shall be unlawful for a landlord to restrict occupancy of residential premises, by express lease terms or otherwise, to a tenant or tenants or to such tenants and immediate family. Any such restriction in a lease or rental agreement entered into or renewed before or after the effective date of this section shall be unenforceable as against public policy."" (https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/RPP/235-F)

2. Not fixing broken locks, windows, or ensuring a safe living space. Under NYS's Warranty of Habilitability, a landlord has a duty to ensure that any building they are leasing is safe and liveable at all times. This includes but is not limited to: Ensuring all exterior windows and doors are functional (open, close, lock, etc.), appliances provided by the landlord are functional, there are no mice/rats/vermin, there is no mold, utilities are working, etc. (https://nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/pdfs/warrantyofhabitability.pdf)

3. Trying to increase rent for any reason: A landlord may not increase the rent of a fixed term lease until after that lease period ends (so for example if you sign a 1 year lease, you only have to pay however much your lease states that you have to pay. If you choose to renew the lease, your landlord can then increase the rent. In other words, if your landlord says ""hey I'm going to increase your rent"" 5 months into a year lease, that's illegal). While your landlord can increase your rent to pay for renovations, they can only do this if you agree to the increase. Keep in mind that this is specifically for fixed-term leases; if you're in a month-to-month lease, they ARE allowed to increase rent, but they must give you at least 30 days written notice. (https://ny.curbed.com/2017/6/15/15810614/new-york-city-landlord-tenant-law-rights)

4. Last month's rent + security deposit: NYS law makes it illegal for a landlord to ask for the last month's rent as well as a security deposit at the beginning of a lease. You can choose to pay both during the first month of the lease, but they cannot coerce you into it. They can only legally ask for a month's worth of rent for any reason at the start of a lease. (https://www.brickunderground.com/rent/difference-between-last-months-rent-and-security-deposit)

5. Giving less than 24 hours notice before entering: A landlord must give at least 24 hours notice before they're allowed to enter the rental property unless you (the tenant) invite them in. So if your landlord knocks on your door and you invite them in, that's fine, but it's not fine for them to just barge in unannounced. The exception to this is if there's an emergency that they need to fix (for example your water main bursts and there's 4 inches of water on your floor) (https://realestateplanninglaw.com/lawyer/2018/01/30/Real-Estate/NY-Landlord-Rights-Right-to-Access_bl32966.htm)

If your landlord is doing any of these things (or is doing something else that seems like it may be illegal, reach out to the RPI Union lawyers. They offer free legal counsel to activity fee-paying RPI students. (https://web.archive.org/web/20171208232013/http://www.union.rpi.edu/student-legal)

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, so please don't take anything I say as real legal advice. If your landlord is being sketchy, reach out to the Union lawyers. They can give you definitive legal advice.

Domesticated rats are not gross >:(,111,fe2tl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fe2tl1/domesticated_rats_are_not_gross/,29,1583445148,"Ok so, I own pet rats. And let me feel you, they are the softest and smartest lil’ creatures you will ever meet. Think of a cat mixed with a guinea-pig. Like, I don’t support most animal testing, but rats are tested on the most for a reason besides how quickly they reproduce. These dudes are smart!! 

They have also never even attempted to bite or scratch me before, they are very hygienic (lick themselves clean more often then cats and adore baths) and love doing tricks or being petted. Ideal pets and companions. 

Yet every time I mention I own rats, people are always like “ew! Gross!” And I genuinely don’t understand why. 
Is it.....like.....because of the plague from a thousand years ago?? Which was from flees and was spread by every mammal??? 

Not to even mention that comparing a domesticated rat to a common feral nyc rat is like comparing a pug to a wolf. Domesticated rats or “fancy rats”(what they are referred to by rodent circles) have been specially bread for about 200 years to be good pets. 

Also if it’s the tails that gross you out, well my good sir, you are wayyy more hairless then them just saying. 

Anyways rats are not gross. People are just misinformed."

The group you smoke countless bowls/blunts with while playing video games well into the night. Halo, COD, shit man, we got a hold of a N64 and got busy playing the usual suspects (WCW vs NWO: Revenge, No Mercy, Goldeneye, Star Fox, Mario Kart, etc). Halo was definitely a priority, and we got really good. My best friend, who we'll call Mick was unusually great at Rat Race, so I just started calling him a fucking rat every time he did some rat shit in the game. It spilled into real life when he played pranks etc. D'Rat. Mick LaRata. There were tons of versions of this. 

Years after we'd all graduated and grown up, for the most part, and most of us had spread all over the world, Mick had finally decided he was staying in town for good. I'd come to visit from NYC, and would stay for a few weeks. My PS3 was still in the home I'd grown up in (didn't bother bringing it as I'd since gotten a sick gaming laptop that doubled as my movie player). I decided to get Fight Night Round 4, just because of Ali and Tyson. The Greatest AND my favorite of all time? Yes plz. It was dumb cheap off ebay, and I brought it back with me. We'd still hang out playing certain games, but there was way less weed, and it was much earlier, since we'd just do that before heading out to a party or bar or something. Another one of the team (Jay) was also in town. We all created boxers and went off on it. It was fun as hell. I ended up taking my PS3 back with me, got tired of FNR3 and basically put my ps3 in a corner. For years. I sold most of the games I had, and only kept Skyrim, RDRUN and Skate 3, since I figured I'd eventually play one of these again, or want to, and had no interest in getting a ps4. 

Mick was the biggest gamer I knew. He was actually pretty active in this sub up until the day he passed away a week before Christmas 2015. I won't go into that, but I'll say that I am most definitely not even close to being over it, and I haven't been back home since the funeral. My sister's getting married in May, so I HAVE to go back, and I'm dreaded every second that the trip inches closer, but it's something that has to be dealt with. 

Last week, I was reorganizing my closet and I see my Guitar Hero: World Tour box tucked into a corner. Looks like I never got rid of it, and everything was in the box. Welp, why not fire it up? PS3 had to update a fuckload, so the GH, I had to charge the Guitar, blah blah blah. Finally, I got jam out to One, then Knights of Cydonia. I was back in college, trying to beat someone's best score to claim this song as my own, hahaha. Then it hit me. ""Do I still have my old saves?"". Connected a controller, got off GH and I checked. MG4, Skyrim, Skate....FNR4. FNR4. It's got a few files. One was for characters. I got on Ebay, ordered the game, and waited. I got it back yesterday and checked. Updates, long loading screen, blah blah blah. Finally, I get to see, and there they were. My character, Junior's, and Mick's. I set the difficulty at max, and I went at him the same way I did last time we'd played, except this time I was angry. I was sad. Overall, though, I was happy as hell. This being the internet and all, I always thought that the [story about the guy that plays his dad's ghost on Xbox](http://s27.postimg.org/66ju7wnwz/ghost_dad.jpg) was cool albeit probably full of shit. Now, if someone out there really did lose their dad and gets to have a piece of them back, I'm really happy for them. I have a piece of my best friend back, even if it's him trying to beat the crap out of me, lol.

Thanks for reading."

When I walk up the front steps to enter our building I almost always see one running around.  I'm worried that for every one or two we see there are five or six we don't.  It's to the point that our neighbors have been putting rat traps in our garbage area to try to kill them.  


What do I do?!  Talk to the neighbors about the situation?  The landlord?  I'm worried that the landlord will simply say we took the apartment in ""as is"" condition (that's what's in our lease).

Am I nuts for trying to help an NYC rat?,67,iuqjfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalRights/comments/iuqjfe/am_i_nuts_for_trying_to_help_an_nyc_rat/,27,1600370942,"I'm assuming that, generally speaking, people who frequent this subreddit will be very high on the compassion scale. At least when we're talking about compassion towards animals. So if you think I'm a bit nuts, the average person would think me totally insane. I had a situation a few nights ago that caused me to question whether my compassion towards animals goes too far at times.

The situation was this. My wife and I walked to a local restaurant for dinner, and on the way we stumbled upon a standard issue NYC rat struggling to free his foot/leg from a subway grate. It seemed highly likely that it had been there for some time, and was obviously totally exhausted. He was trapped right in the path of significant foot traffic, and god knows what sort of abuse he'd endured till then. In my mind, no matter how much I dislike (perhaps even fear) rats, I couldn't let it suffer like that. I assessed the situation, and started trying to figure out how to free the little guy with minimal risk to my health.

My wife was horrified that I'd even consider this. She implied that I didn't care about my health, and by extension hers to risk getting involved. Even more so when it's for a creature that's pretty much universally reviled. I tried to explain that, as crazy as it seemed, I couldn't let it suffer like this. I was either going to free it (if I thought I could safely), or quickly end its misery. As it happened, another compassionate person freed the poor fella and left it where it could safely recover. I checked back on it 30 minutes or so later and it had moved. So I'm hoping it survived the ordeal.

I'm curious if any of you would have thought to intervene if you had been in my place."

"San Francisco, New York are Dumpster Piles",53,ciynnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ciynnv/san_francisco_new_york_are_dumpster_piles/,78,1564334969,"I don't know how people idealize major cities like San Francisco and New York City. They each have major homeless problems, literal shit holes, and unsafe environments to raise families in and unsustainable housing crisis-not to mention traffic.

These cities rely on young people, typically twenty and thirty something's to live off of or rich kids' parents money to fund their trendy downtown apartment.

The Greater Bay Area in general is very safe and clean, as well as the suburbs of New York City. However, with regards to the ACTUAL city themselves, New York City is basically just a rat infested (literally rat infested apartments) expensive tourist trap designed for gullible twenty or thirty year old's and so is the City of San Francisco.

The ONLY reason to be in NYC is if you're working in a highly paid career in Banking or on the west coast in San Francisco in Technology. Aside from those two fields, there's zero reason to be in these cities.

I say this as someone who was born and raised in California and have been here for a few decades and have lived in NYC for a number of years.

NYC and the CITY of San Francisco are unsustainable dumpster piles. Even if you made six figures in either city you're basically living an average life, and even lower income in many parts of the Bay area in the six figure range.

Edit: California is a great place to be in general but it's very unsustainable in the long run for many of the reasons I've listed here and more."

Calling health department on neighbor?,58,ja6nd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/ja6nd3/calling_health_department_on_neighbor/,12,1602563835,"My neighbor is a lunatic. She obviously suffers from substance abuse/addiction(which I don’t judge her for. It is what it is) ... but these past few months I have witnessed her get into borderline physical altercations with her mid/late 70 year old mother. Her mom often comes and drops off items to my neighbor and takes her to & from the house. Typically these interactions ALWAYS end in arguments between the two of them. The daughter refusing to get out of the car and airing all of their dirty laundry. I have called the cops 2 or 3 times, but have since stopped since nothing is ever done. 

She has a dog like Lassie(so think rough collie). The dog is sweet, barks a lot but other than that is cute to look at. Last winter I noticed that she would let the dog out, and I assume would pass out(?) and forget, because the dog would begin barking and whining to come back into the house. I began having concerns about the dog when he ran over to me one day and I noticed how matted he was. Especially near his butt. I was questioning whether he could even properly use the bathroom because it was so bad. I brought up this concern to her mother and a few days later I saw her outside giving the dog a bath & brushing him. And then they took him to what I believe to be the vet. 

For the 3 years I’ve lived here I have not seen a garbage truck come to her house ONCE. I have not seen her take out garbage EVERRR. And I would like to add that she told me she has 3 cats. So in the 3 years of me living here. I have serious questions about whether or not her animals are living in a clean environment or not. Because where is all the cat litter? Recently I saw that her mom & a few men have been coming to and from the house and taking a few trash bags out. Being nosy and listening to one of their arguments I learned that the mother almost lost the house because when the police+paramedics came to do a wellness check and saw what the inside of the house looks like. Welllllll. Fast forward to the past month. I’ve noticed the trash just piling outside the front of her house & on her driveway. There must be at least 6 or 7 pales of cat litter. At first I thought someone would come grab the trash but nobody has. Normally I would mind my business until one day the porch light turned on & I looked to see 2 HUGE RATS on my front porch. And I mean like NYC Rats. I am beginning to have concerns about whether or not her leaving all of that garbage in her driveway is what is attracting them. 

Over the years living here I’ve seen small mice, moles, raccoons, skunks, deer & even a black bear once. But never a rat. 

I’m definitely thinking about calling the health department & possibly even animal control because of my concern for her pets. I just need advice on how to go about it? Should I reach out to the mother first?"

I think it's the only place where rats scurrying about carrying slice's of pizza seems normal and not revolting. I don't know what it is about the city, but all the small things in life that seem to annoy me all add to NYC's charm. There is so much to do, so much history, so much vibrance. I love this place."
